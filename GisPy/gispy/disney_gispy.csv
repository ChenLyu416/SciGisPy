0,no_1.txt,"90% of Americans think vaccines for measles are safe: Poll
A new CBS News poll on vaccines in America shows some shifting views on vaccines since the measles outbreak started in Dec. 2014. Concerning the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR), nine out of 10 people polled believe vaccines for measles are safe and that its not likely linked to autism.
Other aspects of the survey of more than 1,000 adults nationwide reveal that two-thirds of Americans (66 percent) of Americans say parents should be required to vaccinate their children while about the same amount believe children who are not vaccinated should not be allowed to attend public school.
Three-quarters of those polled believe the measles outbreak is very or somewhat serious.
Politically, more Republicans polled believe vaccination of children should be left to the parents discretion (38%) than do Democrats or Independents.
On the topic of vaccine safety, six out of 10 people surveyed believe vaccines are very safe, with younger adults being more skeptical of the safety of vaccines.",6,7,27.857142857142858,0,0.9158390065034231,0.8447318701517015,0.1206834614276886,0.1206834614276886,0.0,0.24826140288749468,0.33335448548778135,0.04318166791150967,0.17087592995015993,0.1886188893214516,0.2439283958190809,0.02787253749039438,0.16892752203617303,0.03009936297606093,0.24566186044722962,0.050023199491309255,0.11881782304488014,1.0226274144896994,0.2009977093596512,0.14581977891980422,1.2622609162578144,0.25172968636104837,0.1617823038986633,1.314375332085926,0.2730544352099239,0,0.005952380952380952,0,0.07905138339920949,3.116678187039767,3.520834434031654,0,0,1.082051282051282,6.874618970772817,10.251406717518337,-1.017248487470282,-1.1260736132545763,1.0773755934599953,,2.4247230951764798,3.3837601661306183,-1.0086560525461485,-0.9966889250601332,-0.7823310051255915,-3.5213902162445563,-0.9667896989065874,-1.8500701307767258,-2.033414143267368,-1.054861225863448,2.4188956498775527,-1.7770390142872075,-0.09745189147962922,-1.5674044419642157,-1.6177536162242354,-1.6043663475638075,-0.2626284124819993,-0.1765231699986378,-0.27697642183685384,-1.2323874328976183,-1.4607641789372037,-1.3334223482621974,0.5372576885415072,-0.4813040148672856,0.5812848611427764,-0.9902743599907043,-0.8712333712913799,-1.1385573984231125,2.3013034034288613,-0.487881689535318,-0.6961305799538194,,,-1.3477615245727523,1.0026007385288727,3.2988539628783853,0,-9.551888240955009
1,no_10.txt,"Reviewers in uproar over book: Melanies Marvelous Measles
I can think of a lot of words to describe measles. But marvelous definitely isnt one of them.
And yet, this book actually exists:
Yes, for just $11.74, you too can be the proud owner of the exhilarating childrens tale, Melanies Marvelous Measles!
While I have not had the privilege of reading the unfortunately-titled book in its entirety, this is how Australian author Stephanie Messenger describes it:
Melanies Marvelous Measles was written to educate children on the benefits of having measles and how you can heal from them naturally and successfully. Often today, we are being bombarded with messages from vested interests to fear all diseases in order for someone to sell some potion or vaccine, when, in fact, history shows that in industrialized countries, these diseases are quite benign and, according to natural health sources, beneficial to the body. Having raised three children vaccine-free and childhood disease-free, I have experienced many times when my childrens vaccinated peers succumb to the childhood diseases they were vaccinated against. Surprisingly, there were times when my unvaccinated children were blamed for their peers sickness. Something which is just not possible when they didnt have the diseases at all.
Written back in 2012, Melanies Marvelous Measles has now resurfaced in the midst of alarming clusters of measles in the United States. The books renewed attention has also inspired nearly 1,200 (wildly disapproving) Amazon customer reviews. Here are some of the most helpful ones, for your enjoyment:
1) Theres nothing quite like preparing your children for their impending doom!
2) The authors website may contain a virus. How ironic.
3) Hey, at least this lady is reaping the benefits of Messengers message.
4) Well, this is just rude.
5) This reviewer provides some helpful suggestions for riveting sequels!
6) What, no Braille version?
7) Actually, I think this review pretty much sums it up:
No matter which side of the vaccination debate youre on, I doubt most people would choose the word marvelous to describe measles.
Just no.

2,no_102.txt,"What others are saying about Christie's vaccination remarks
TRENTON Gov. Chris Christie's comments today over whether children should be vaccinated sparked a wave of reaction across the web.
Christie, a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for president, told reporters during a trade mission to England that ""parents need to have some measure of choice"" on whether their children are immunized. Kevin Roberts, a spokesman for the governor's office, clarified Christie's position, saying ""the governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated.""
Here is a roundup of what publications are saying about the comments:
TIME: Chris Christie's Terrible Vaccine Advice
Jeffrey Kluger, an editor-at-large for the magazine, writes that ""when it comes to medicine, the current governor, former prosecutor and never doctor evidently feels pretty free to dispense advice. And doncha' know it? That advice turns out to be terrible.""
Washington Post: What Chris Christie gets wrong about vaccine deniers
Paul Waldman writes that ""it's great that Christie vaccinated his children, but it's also completely irrelevant. And what he thinks as a parent is absolutely not more important than what he thinks as a public official. Want to know why? Because he's a public official.""
New York Magazine: Chris Christie: Scientists Have a Point About Vaccines, But So Do Crazy People
Jonathan Chalt writes that ""for the first time in a public career defined by overweening and often-bullying certainty about everything, Christie has finally found an issue where he sees both sides. And it's an issue where science and public health are utterly unanimous!""
The Atlantic: Courting the Anti-Vax Vote
David A. Graham writes that Christie ""is being derided as a 'vexer,' but his statement is a little more nuanced than he's getting credit for.""
The Onion: Chris Christie On Vaccines: Parents Should Have 'Measure Of Choice'
The satirical site asks others what they think about Christie's comments. ""Interesting. I didn't know Iowa voters felt that way about vaccinations,"" one man says.
And here is a look at what some are saying on Twitter:
Taking vaccination advice from Chris Christie is like taking advice from me about how to do a perfect sit-up.

3,no_11.txt,"Italian Courts in Milan Concluded MMR Vaccine Causes Autism
(TRFW News) In the conventional medical system, vaccine is heavily promoted and touted as a necessity for a childs life. This is perhaps one of the reasons why many parents do not think twice when they take their child in for vaccinations, which may have a life-altering or life-ending consequence in a childs health more than one can expect.
In just under a year ago, on September 23, 2014, the Italian courts in Milan awarded compensation to a young boy for vaccine-induced autism. (1,2) The side effects of Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine has been known in the last 15 years and a considerable amount of attention has been circulating in other parts of the world, yet the U.S. has been silent about this. (1,3)
In 2012, Italian courts ruled MMR causes autism
On May 23rd, 2012, Jude Lucio Ardigo of an Italian court in Rimini concluded that the MMR vaccine had caused the 15-month old boy to develop autism. (4) The boy received MMR vaccinations at 15-month of age in 2004 and immediately his parents noticed bowel issues, refusing to eat, and a change of behavior. It quickly went downhill and the child eventually received an autism diagnosis with cognitive delay within a year. (1)
The boys parents immediately suspected the vaccination was the cause, but they were told that it was impossible. The parents decided to fight and initially were denied compensation by the Ministry of Healths compensation program. However, after valid medical evidence, the court found that the boy had has been irreversibly damaged by complications caused by vaccination (prophylaxis trivalent MMR). (4)
The boy and his family was awarded a 15-year annuity totaling 174,000 Euros, which is just under $220,000, plus additional reimbursements from all court costs. The news has been featured in the Italian press and later an article was published in the UK, but the U.S. press did nothing. (3)
Luca Ventaloro the family lawyer, stated: This is very significant for Britain which uses, and has used, an MMR vaccine with the same components as the one given to Valentino. It is wrong for governments and their health authorities to exert strong pressure on parents to take children for the MMR jab while ignoring that this vaccine can cause autism and linked conditions. (5)
MMR research proved accurate, yet seen as controversial
Dr. Andrew Wakefield, a former British surgeon and medical researcher, suggested a correlation between the MMR vaccine, chronic bowel disease, and autism. This research was published in the journal The Lancet in 1998. Ever since this publication, much controversy arose causing it to be one of the most controversial studies on the topic of vaccine safety. (6,7)
Many public health officials or doctors ignored the fact about what Wakefields research actually showed and 28 other studies from around the world that back up his findings. As a result, Wakefields research was discredited by the medical officials in Britain causing his reputation to be destroyed. (6)
Even though Wakefields 1998 study is the only known study, there have been many other studies published around the world that were all peer-reviewed and supported Wakefields findings. While none of those studies were withdrawn, it was never discussed in the U.S. media. (6)
For example, at the 2006 International Meeting for Autism Research, Steve Walker, Ph.D., shared a finding that confirmed Dr. Wakefields research. Walker and a group of researchers from Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina conducted a study that examined children with regressive autism and bowel disease. (8)
A total of 82 patients were tested at the time and 70 were found positive for the vaccine strain of the measles virus in the gastrointestinal tract. This study suggests a link between the MMR vaccine in the digestive tract, chronic bowel inflammation, and symptoms of regressive autism. (8) This finding was exactly the same the Dr. Wakefield discovered in 1998.
Contradiction between Italian and U.S. courts
There is a difference in court decisions between the Italian and U.S. courts. The Omnibus Autism Proceeding, the court assigned three Special Masters decision makers to resolve the autism cases. These Special Masters concluded that vaccines do not cause autism in any of the six cases they tested. Clearly, the Italian courts strikingly contrasts the U.S. courts based on similar claims. (9,10)
When it comes to vaccines, it is perhaps wise to be educated on all the potential benefits and risks in order to decide what is the best course of action for your child.",17,45,19.444444444444443,0,0.3156808216907931,0.27383278332653016,0.20527176613298556,0.17723365750930764,0.28888888888888886,0.4159050092101097,0.40956654313945984,0.3291921676597511,0.4030893602784998,0.26155057521536945,0.22596571995491552,0.1829530065982706,0.2237788421551442,0.11925472109368689,1.0151452633405493,0.2096411000098471,0.1554492207040956,1.3064869072866523,0.26360259864088625,0.16874054571806824,1.401637641744267,0.28499557793283375,0.17072029739021669,1.4052078192864708,0.28557259080960085,0.013257575757575758,0.015873015873015872,0.0375,0.02808641975308642,3.1695826138981884,3.5622324129233114,0,0,1.199362120068227,6.5783018212759075,9.124571795134239,0.09391666121572108,0.5156305553849241,-0.5928120844716478,,-2.678891622912197,-1.1464884611482082,-0.24285602772509773,-0.4758727168629373,0.361935173566234,0.8672323657841757,1.4872277014913566,0.853544827248054,1.6744982760839446,1.315553783620462,1.506514568751101,0.8655761359405654,1.3034187903167134,0.5695382869211039,0.6401487065701179,0.7126057571834735,1.2651710724620508,1.2724854801539525,1.3049196111109411,1.195848130940518,1.3356956909576847,1.5162345897570748,1.7615560389272138,1.5367030804483053,1.9061263639630026,-0.5502355327669064,-0.5379918162621243,0.006205584173606567,-0.4965241304614897,0.2621463555605241,-0.01594690510474705,,,1.0636053061223045,0.041003252222079754,-0.6472077911934085,0,2.0319226694403807
4,no_12.txt,"Catholic clerics renew fight against tetanus jab
Nairobi Archbishop John Cardinal Njue led hundreds of Catholic clerics in a renewed onslaught against State-led tetanus vaccination, asking thousands of church faithful in Mombasa not to accept the jab.
The church leaders spoke yesterday at the installation of Bishop Martin Kivuva as the new Archbishop of the Catholic Archdiocese of Mombasa. They criticised political leaders for failure to bridge widening religious and tribal differences and called on the Government to tackle the problem of drug abuse in Mombasa, saying many youth have been turned into zombies.
The leaders, in their message christened That All Be One said the country was at a crossroad and theological and ideological differences among Christians and Muslims was widening. Cardinal Njue said the controversial tetanus vaccination was being pushed from somewhere else, adding, we will not fear fighting for our dignity. It is suspect that this vaccine is targeting women. We must be courageous enough to say No, he told the faithful at Mombasa Stadium. He also criticised the push to introduce contraceptives to primary school children, saying the move was a sign the country had lost its morals.
The Catholic church has been opposed to the Government-led tetanus vaccination, forcing the State to form a taskforce to investigate the churchs claims that the jab was a ploy to introduce a family planning vaccination. Last week, Muranga Bishop James Wainaina who is also in charge of the Health Commission for the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops told a media briefing that their findings had revealed the jab was laced with contraceptives for family planning.
There was heavy security at the stadium during the ceremony also attended by Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua and his Taita Taveta counterpart John Mruttu. Others were Mombasa Deputy Governor Hazel Katana, Nyali MP Hezron Awiti and several MPs from Machakos County. Archbishop Kivuva comes to the region when it is facing challenges of radicalisation against the youth.
Yesterday, Archbishop Kivuva, who was initially a priest in the region before being posted to Nairobi to work for Ukweli video productions and later as Bishop of Machakos, said he will strive to strengthen the interfaith religious group in the region to combat radicalisation. He added that the few clerics advancing the Islamists ideology had little knowledge of Islam.
He said the region has suffered economically due to insecurity and radicalisation, adding that he will establish an interface section to bring together religious, political and professional groups to tackle the problem. As religious leaders we cannot allow ourselves to be swallowed by traditional fights that characterised our religions in the past, he said.
He said there was need for coast people to value one another and bury tribal and religious differences. Mombasa has witnessed a relatively calm period since last year when it was rocked by acts of terror-related insecurity it blamed on controversial ideologies preached by a section of radical Muslim clerics.
Yesterday, the Anglican Church of Kenya Mombasa Diocese Bishop Julius Kalu welcomed Kivuva, saying he will lead the Catholic Church and Christians in the region to combat radicalisation and terrorism.
Archbishop Kivuva comes to the region when as Christians we look up to the Catholic church to lead in uniting Christians in the fight against radicalisation and insecurity, said Bishop Kalu.
Kivuva comes with a wider knowledge about the region, having served as a priest in various churches in the archdiocese of Mombasa. He was first appointed an assistant priest in Mwatate Parish in Taita Taveta County in 1979 before he was transferred to Kongowea, Mombasa to serve as the priest of Our Lady of Fatma Parish where he at the same time officiated as the chaplain to Kenya Armed Forces in Nyali Barracks.
Between 1989 and 1992, he worked as a social communication coordinator for the Archdiocese of Mombasa.",13,25,27.6,0,0.5634464945954581,0.3098216023777301,0.19073673688734955,0.19260334321894707,0.04,0.43657056358074997,0.41013617441326705,0.2637290511962159,0.3269836832671705,0.20857613187328708,0.19851024197526726,0.1370796759523468,0.1646914349887088,0.09749055653584597,0.8528182184574263,0.1686701032603024,0.12819383340939877,1.1089907378104658,0.21969714888976116,0.14827861700350228,1.2878196571369553,0.2551642066432506,0.1484953800125118,1.2862822042510464,0.25500991312394133,0.027604166666666666,0.022832722832722835,0.024390243902439025,0.03585071995298266,3.155729142740938,3.573933135648787,0,0,1.116103774274506,6.006804851355557,9.018389984749707,-0.3101433928519164,-0.3484242702148129,1.0263245738703868,,-0.5719462093989716,-0.8609068200726245,-0.3744454453858791,-0.3343209277069154,-0.6238941496144156,1.4082211966173859,1.5055697473671243,0.2347316682013635,0.4592663036074236,-0.4062138414934816,0.11196406462002476,0.0838815792133738,-0.2056390807297459,0.04787840933101022,0.16383094543867946,0.11788137937873192,0.12842037956806185,0.2643329779309646,0.19551972903317894,-0.9718971040571598,-0.947952639247912,-1.039210947680148,-1.2827435243580723,-1.105443384465597,-1.3284319152394275,-0.07405065902115388,-0.30421004842621574,-0.3939961089293114,-0.07028674448991051,0.06574517503795213,0.17630017542622964,,,-0.6478001941650476,-1.813597639560222,-1.019045735344099,0,-0.17083908024210515

NEW DELHI: A three-month-old child died in south-east Delhi's Jaitpur area on Friday morning after which family members alleged that she fell ill after being vaccinated with anti-rotavirus vaccine. Police have sent the body for postmortem, but no case has been registered.
The child, Iqra, was vaccinated on November 28. On Thursday night the child had a high fever and died on Friday morning. The infant was taken to a local hospital in Khadda colony where doctors suspected a reaction from vaccination. Following this, the parents approached the police. The body was then taken to AIIMS for postmortem.
The child's father Shahabuddin said that the vaccination was done by officials from Centre for Health Research and Development at a camp in the colony.
CHRD officials said that vials of medicine used for vaccination are always tested before being administered.

6,no_129.txt,"Fake church set up in Australia to evade vaccination for children
New no jab, no play childcare laws introduced in two Australian states have prompted a controversial anti-vaccination group to create a church of its own that rejects vaccination, but is actually merely a business, according to local media reports.
The Australian Vaccination Skeptics Network has set up the Church of Conscious Living as a religion that could help skip the vaccination, crucial to enroll in childcare under a New South Wales 2013 law, as well as Victorias proposed law set to start in 2016, The Age newspaper reported Wednesday.
According to the new laws, children who are not fully immunized are unable to receive pre-school education unless their parents declare they have a special medical, personal, philosophical or religious reason to refuse the vaccinations for their children. The same document is needed to get a tax benefit for families with children.
A parents conscientious objection must be signed by a doctor after counseling on the pros and cons of vaccination, and sent to the federal government's department of human services. However, as many general medical practitioners refuse to sign the form, people are resorting to the new church, which insists on the use [of] holistic and nature-based medicines among Earths sacred laws.
READ MORE: Vaccines dont cause autism, complications extremely rare study
But eight years ago, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission registered the Church of Conscious Living as a business, rather than a church or charity. Whats more, it doesnt deny its purposes and levies an entrance fee, as its newsletter said in 2007: We have decided to create a 'religion', so, amongst other things, we can claim 'religious exemption', if the need ever arises, for ourselves and our children.
Commenting on the anti-vaccination church, a spokeswoman for the Australian Federal Department of Health told The Age newspaper that it would closely look at the organization, though outlining that vaccination is not compulsory.
Setting up a church will not alter the requirement for parents to discuss vaccination with a doctor and obtain a signed objection form, she said.

The Australian Vaccination Skeptics Association, formerly known as the Australian Vaccination Network, was renamed after an order by the NSW government, based on an inquiry that found the network was spreading misinformation. Both the network and the Church of Conscious Living both failed to respond to calls for comment, the newspaper said.
David Hawkes, a leading Australian virologist, called the church a devious sham.
None of the major religions, such as Judaism, Islam, Christianity, none of them have an issue with vaccination, he said. If you're 23 years old and you choose not to have a blood transfusion or chemotherapy for cancer, I strongly believe that's your right but these decisions are being made for children who do not have a say in it.
Since 2008, eight Australian babies have died of whooping cough, a highly contagious bacterial disease with a high death rate among children, the Herald Sun newspaper reported. In 2013, California was hit by the largest whooping cough outbreak in 60 years and it was blamed on parents who objected to the vaccination of their children.
The anti-vaccination movement, or vaccine hysteria, has emerged with the vaccination technique itself. It irrationally links vaccines with such disorders as autism, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), or the covert spread of AIDS.",15,22,30.272727272727273,0,0.6805466605084283,0.43700724532545515,0.1609207421541214,0.1609207421541214,0.18181818181818182,0.35905670492641933,0.3565896866291069,0.19395972816946191,0.3332668834093653,0.21910685964234888,0.19327651586808384,0.08250681554691659,0.19635435349441,0.074871134733046,0.6336136015286856,0.12756730865660423,0.13872632337776453,1.1982959300159075,0.24335593905827985,0.14908370525260678,1.287367594531853,0.25931386797872796,0.15006665421912016,1.290664258136089,0.2600542231354626,0.013333333333333334,0.01111111111111111,0.028169014084507043,0.01917057902973396,3.146280041598319,3.5424816513764275,0,0,1.1279800665102062,6.550838939700868,9.299083892037585,-0.10811336581809766,-0.4780324940547735,1.5569457774835922,,0.42384814176969954,0.14834787602037,-0.6443774364137194,-0.6261114659499887,-0.062163480074792145,-0.620958907370205,-0.21861953188179953,-0.4247874246726199,0.5595945051570596,-0.06394566465630201,-0.15387342641425533,-0.8460554304453803,0.6030133662585367,-0.4942809176419289,-0.4793832056003499,-0.47875614194279037,0.5677029015877859,0.7202063916898928,0.7933284104573923,-0.886605720234356,-0.9570228403839811,-0.6837384003848025,-1.0675153055221371,-1.0080881748416768,-0.7945744149757762,-0.5477210251827704,-0.6979477626761671,-0.2786415429513986,-0.9859777252248004,-0.06821508648945253,-0.3404590172826324,,,-0.40367869905926446,-0.04811827832090553,-0.03608410525351555,0,-1.6816489453167085

The head of the World Health Organization once again denounced the large pharmaceutical corporations for not having created an Ebola vaccine. As she noted, they put profit over everything. No surprise there, as this is, alas, how capitalism works.
If corporations are people, as Mitt Romney seemed to believe, they are money-making, amoral people and few are dedicated to the public good. Some, perhaps many, companies have the public good as their mission, but the mission of most corporations is to maximize return for the shareholders. It is not to help poor or sick people. It is not to improve quality of life. It is not to clean the environment.
I believe that the resource-rich West has been remiss in almost every way in its dealings with the poor countries. These countries only seem to exist when theres a problem or some group has a politically important base in the United States.
Ebola was not a Western problem until Americans contracted it. Western aid to the poor, which may sound like a lot in terms of dollars, is minuscule and often is used to reward the lender, by forcing the borrower to buy American products, thereby rewarding American interest groups under the guise of helping the poor.
However, unlike the WHO, I do not believe the pharmaceutical corporations are obliged to create vaccines or therapies for the common good. It would be nice if they did, but this is not their mission. I do not say this lightly. I just dont think that pharmaceutical companies are different than other corporations.
Even doctors turn away poor patients. Are large contractors obligated to build housing for poor people? Do we expect Toyota to give cars to poor people because they cant find a job unless they have a car? Should a private corporation be obliged to help the poor? Should manufacturers of sewage treatment plants be forced to create plants in an impoverished area with sewage problems, which would probably be medically much more cost effective than developing vaccines anyway?
It is true that drug companies have developed vaccines. Companies that develop vaccines have gotten waivers against lawsuits that may occur if adequate safety testing did not reveal evidence of rare side effects. In addition, the government has subsidized pharmaceutical research and development for vaccines.
Most Americans, and probably the vast majority of the worlds population, believe that the development of vaccines for poor regions and treatment for diseases of poor areas is a responsibility of wealthy governments, whether the problem is within their country or not. They should also fund the research independently of, or in collaboration with, pharmaceutical companies.
This is about more than the obvious good of enhancing health. Epidemics, even in poor areas, may destabilize large regions of the world and lead to chaos and terrorism, posing a threat to national security. Even the possibility of Ebolas spreading to the United States caused terror in our country, leading to a large outlay of money for training, treatment and disease assessment, and quarantine.
In the case of Ebola, the outlay for a response, while very large, may not equal the investment required for a vaccine. On the other hand, such an investment would certainly be seen as a wise one if failing to create a vaccine permits an epidemic in the United States.
There is no reason the wealthy world cannot come together to develop vaccines or better treatments for the major killers in the world: malaria, TB, cholera and some minor ones as well, such as Ebola. Until the Ebola scare, U.S. government investment in vaccines actually dropped over the last few years.

8,no_133.txt,"Myths About ""Anti-Vaxxers"" that Need to be Debunked. NOW.
There has been a ton of media hubbub over the measles outbreak that has been birthed out of the land of happiness aka Disneyland. The disease is making a cross-country migration and is now being found in some mid-western states. There have been nearly 100 cases and (thankfully) no deaths. The culprits? Those darn ""anti-vaxxers"" of course! They MUST be the cause of such a preventable outbreak.
Unfortunately, there is no political correctness when it comes to talking about these families who refuse to vaccinate their children. Thus, they are subject to public shaming by the media, peers and even by our very own here on BlogHer (gasp! here and here to name a couple). Speak out about ANY minority in a negative way and you're automatically labelled a racist, bigot, homophobe, etc. Speak out against anti-vaxxers? You're a proper American citizen.
With all that said, I felt that it was time to shed some light on some myths that I've seen circulating through the media and the messages boards concerning parents who don't vaccinate their children. Please keep in mind that this is NOT an article meant to start any debate or to say one side is better than the other. I'm speaking a lot from personal experience to show that we (WHAT?! I'm one of them??!?) are normal people just like the rest of the American public who are navigating this life trying to do what we feel is best for our children and our families. I'm not hating on anyone and I'm not angry. Just trying to have a good time and bring some balance to the media circus that's been performing recently. (Trapeze, anyone?)
Myth #1: All anti-vaxxers are anti-vaccination and think they are evil.
I really detest the term ""anti-vaxxer"" because it's lumping a large, diverse group of people into a narrow category. There are people who fit that bill, but a lot of parents delay vaccinations, vaccinate on a schedule that spreads them out and some would vaccinate if their children were able to be vaccinated. I personally don't think vaccines are evil. I know they've done a lot of good and saved lives, but they are honestly being undeservedly worshiped in our culture. They are a man-made medical advance just like all the other pharmaceuticals out there. What does that mean? People aren't perfect and neither are their products. Did you know that over the counter sleep aids and Benedryl, among other OTC meds, are linked to a greater risk for dementia? If something as simple as non-prescription medicine can be so dangerous for adults, then why is it wrong to question the safety of vaccines? They have individual components that are more harmful than OTC meds, they are injected directly into the body - not dissolved over 4-8 hours - and they are being put into babies and young children. I'm not anti-vaccination. I'm pro-vaccine-safety. Vaccines aren't one-size-fits-all and are therefore more dangerous for different people. A great organization that is pro-vaccine-safety is the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC). They provide reasonable, unbiased information about vaccines that is beneficial to any family who want to vaccinate or don't want to vaccinate their children.
Myth #2: Anti-vaxxers get all their info on vaccines from Jenny McCarthy and Andrew Wakefield.
Hahaha! Sorry I just had to laugh at that one. Really, it's funny seeing how many people believe that every parent in every part of the country who decides to not vaccinate or delay vaccination is some cult follower of Jenny McCarthy or has only heard of Dr. Andrew Wakefield and his debunked MMR-autism study. There are plenty of resources out there who are exposing the truth about vaccines and how dangerous they are. As I mentioned before, the NVIC is one of them. There's also the World Association for Vaccine Education (WAVE), Think Twice Global Vaccine Institute and Vaccination News - an organization that publishes current news articles and studies that are on both sides of the vaccine debate. Those are just a few of the many resources out there.
Myth #3: Anti-vaxxers are selfish and irresponsible, willingly exposing their children AND others to deadly diseases.
There will always be irresponsible people anywhere. BUT if you ask the average parent who hasn't vaccinated their child why they are making that choice, they will likely share stories from the tragic experience of having a vaccine injured child or the many reasons that the organizations above present that show that vaccines aren't as safe as the media and medical community portray them to be. And PLEASE. What person would willingly expose their own child or someone else's child to an illness on purpose? This past fall, I visited a friend who had a one month old baby. My youngest (who was 1 at the time; he just turned 2) had just started coughing during the night, so I left him home with my husband. It's common courtesy. I don't want my own kids to get sick, so why would I want to infect someone else's? I mean, really, who does that? Does the public actually think that I'm parading my kids around looking for a way to get them sick? Do vaccinating parents parade their kids around illness to prove the shots work? No, of course not. We're not willingly trying to get our kids sick and we're sure as heck not trying to get anyone else's kids sick. It's not irresponsible to make an informed decision about my own child's healthcare. Vaccines are a choice, not a mandate. The CDC only ""recommends"" them anyway, am I right? The last time someone ""recommended"" something to me, I knew I was free to decline it if I wished.
Myth #4: Parents who don't vaccinate think they're children are more important than yours.
For real? What I think is implied in this myth is, ""I've made the sacrifice of vaccinating my child for the good of society, so every other parent must too. No child is better than another."" Yes, no child is above another in the sense that one doesn't deserve certain privileges over other children. But are parents implying that by not vaccinating their kids? No! We're doing what we believe is best for our children. Yes, I like my children more than yours - because I'm their mom. Yes, I love my children more than yours - because I'm their mom. If both of our kids are in a burning building and I can only save one, would I pick my own? Of course! Because I'm his MOM. What parent isn't biased toward their own child? But still, if my kid hits yours or misbehaves in public, I'll take action on your child's behalf! I love my children a lot, but I'm not unreasonable and I don't think my children deserve anything better than your children. We're all trying to do the best we can for our own families.
Myth #5: All anti-vaxxers are hippies, affluent and gluten free.
Now this one seems a bit contradictory because I have't heard of any rich hippies. Unless they were a hippie celebrity. Or the child of a celebrity. But there's this assumption that parents who don't vaccinate are rich or hippies or totally natural in their food choices. While a lot of non-vaccinating families might fall into one or more of these categories, it by no means describes everyone. I have a lot of close friends who don't vaccinate or have delayed vaccination and they are not hippies. Nor are they rich. Some are gluten free though. Which is fine. But to make not vaccinating sound like a trend? No. Definitely not a trend. (Side note: Being gluten free isn't a trend either. It's starting to be trendy, but some people get seriously messed up by that stuff. Not fun. Total respect to people who go without gluten.) Why would someone willingly sign up to shamed by the... um... ENTIRE COUNTRY just to be ""cool?"" The last time I heard, that doesn't describe something cool or trendy. This isn't a trend. It's a serious life decision that isn't made or taken lightly - no matter what a person's background.
Myth #6: Anti-vaxxers' kids are doomed to die. Doomed!
There has been a pervading assumption that children who are not vaccinated or are on a delayed schedule are these ticking time bombs waiting to go off and infect everybody or die. Like these kids are walking around just waiting to be infected. But choosing not to vaccinate is not a death sentence for a child. The incidence of these diseases are far lower than they were in the past, even with the epidemics that pop up every now and then. And there are credible doctors speaking out about how there is no reason to panic even about the current measles outbreak (here and here). If you would like to read a well cited and scientific article about measles and the history of the vaccine, then click here. With proper nutrition alone, a non-vaccinated child would most likely be able to fight off illness without even needing any medical intervention.
Myth #7: Parents who don't vaccinate are foregoing vaccinations necessary for survival.
Now I know this myth sounds similar to the previous one, but it is different in this way - not all of the ""recommended"" vaccines are necessary for a child's survival. Example? The Hepatitis B vaccine. First given at birth, then around 1-2 months of age and finally between 6-18 months of age, this vaccine seriously is pointless. When I was pregnant with our first son and researching all about vaccines, because I wanted to think objectively on the matter, I went to the experts themselves and realized how unnecessary this shot is. The CDC says that babies whose mothers are infected can be infected at birth. They also say that children, adolescents and adults can get infected through bodily fluids, breaks in the skin, sharing toothbrushes, razors or diabetes monitoring devices, having unprotected sex and sharing needles when injecting drugs. Okay. So let's think critically about this - babies could only get infected if their moms are sick. Since when does that mean that every baby should get injected then if only a few moms might have Hep B? Also, what child between birth and 18 months is going to be sexually active or using drugs? Furthermore, yes, they could perhaps maybe get infected if they were around a sick person and came in contact with that person's bodily fluids. However, with proper supervision, that child shouldn't. I'm not letting my 18 month old or younger child play with my own toothbrush let alone anyone else's. So yes. Hep B = ridiculous for the vast majority of babies.
But what about the measles vaccine and pertussis and all the other ones? Yes, there are scary diseases out there. But we now live in an age with exceptional medical care and proper sanitation. A lot of these diseases were already on the decline beforevaccines were introduced, but the vaccines got the credit because they road the wave into shore as it was dying down.
Myth #8: Anti-vaxxers are exhibiting parental neglect and child endangerment by not vaccinating.
To this I say, ""Pfffft!!! Hahaha!"" Really? This isn't a joke? Oh. Ok. This one is preposterous at best and terrifying at worst. Parents have the right to choose how to care for and raise their children. I'm the one that knows my child best - not doctors, not the CDC - me. And my husband. We know our kids and we are the ones who decide what goes into their bodies. The same goes for parents who choose to vaccinate. If that's you, you have that right. Just because we disagree with people who are pro-vaccines doesn't mean that we aren't fit to be parents. I'm not saying parents on either side are better or worse than the other. A lot of non-vaccinating families eat healthier because they've learned that proper nutrition = proper health. Food was made to heal our bodies. We are taking great care to ensure our children are nourished properly so that their little bodies are capable of fighting illness in its own power. I personally think that parents who don't vaccinate their kids are somewhat at an advantage in a way because if their child gets sick, they aren't assuming a safety net of excluding certain illnesses. What I mean is that when my kids sick, my radar goes way up. I'm constantly monitoring them to make sure they aren't beginning to show symptoms of something more serious. I don't think, ""Well, they can't have this because they received that shot."" And I'm not saying vaccinated parents think that way. It just helps me to always be on the look out. I have a mental check list in my mind of symptoms that warrant a trip to the ER. So does proper nutrition and parental supervision count as neglect or endangerment? Umm no. Not at all.
Myth #9: Anti-vaxxers aren't performing their civic duty to vaccinate their children.
My duty is to my family first and then my country. This isn't about calling parents to perform some patriotic responsibility so much as it is just a way to guilt families into compromising their convictions and beliefs on vaccines to be a ""better"" citizen. It's manipulation and it's uncalled for. I can see why people would believe it though. It makes sense. But at its root, the idea of ""doing your duty"" by getting vaccinated really just takes away a parent's freedom to choose how to take care of their child. Vaccination is a choice. Not a mandate. Not a duty. It is a decision that parents should make for their own children without being treated like they are subhuman for thinking differently than the vast majority.
Myth #10: Anti-vaxxers blindly believe whatever they are told about vaccines.
On the contrary, parents who question and investigate the safety of vaccines aren't just believing what ever they're told about them. We dig and dig and dig some more because the evidence is out there that shows what vaccines are really like. It's not on the media because: public shaming. Just because Yahoo News or Huffington Post isn't publishing articles about the dangers of vaccines or the countless families who have injured child(ren) because of them, doesn't mean these stories aren't out there or are false. I find it quite humorous and ironic that ""anti-vaxxers"" are being accused of the very thing that the majority of the public is already doing. You know, because none of the articles about the Disney measles outbreak are sensationalized or over hyped at all. All the flu vaccine articles that come out around October aren't like propaganda at all... At least the media was honest about how ineffective it was this year! That's a first!
Myth #11: Parents who don't vaccinate hate the parents that do. Hate I say!
Heck no! I'm sure a lot of parents delaying or opting out of vaccination would agree with me when I say that I don't hate or judge any parent who chooses to vaccinate their children. That is your choice and yours alone to make. If you believe that is what's best for your family, then go for it. Like I said, I don't think vaccines are evil. I respect your decision to be the parent of your own child. We deserve to be respected too. We're parents just like everybody else trying to do what we feel is best for our family. It's despicable that our society isn't mature enough to handle a civil, objective and open discussion on this matter. The media are the ones who should be shamed for how terribly they have treated innocent families throughout this debacle. I know that there have been ugly words said from both sides of the vaccine debate, but I can assure you that the majority of parents who don't vaccinate or delay vaccination totally respect the parents that have fully vaccinated kids. I would still be friends with you. And if my kids were sick? I would keep them home.
No matter where you stand on the issue of vaccines, I encourage you to watch an incredible documentary called The Greater Good. It mostly follows the story of how a teenage girl's life was affected by the HPV vaccine and discusses openly and honestly the truth about how safe vaccines really are.
On a final note, I would like to say thank you for reading. Blessings on you and please be kind in the comments. Please rise above the societal norm and show some kindness and understanding to people on either side of this complicated issue.",29,202,16.504950495049506,0,0.35899333820321516,0.19602820593682976,0.1932383734203377,0.17186062850461284,0.14356435643564355,0.3996126667241483,0.375458913146835,0.3715218131621824,0.31186457661278805,0.24603362685672533,0.20975485910111036,0.2148913588416738,0.1823941389777775,0.15048099861437889,1.241624076764337,0.2509808784987418,0.1384177902332811,1.1402259732343947,0.23030114797396417,0.16131869610871766,1.3453936128956006,0.2702588876372061,0.16068187581385293,1.346047402452852,0.26989390963246457,0.07125,0.04914999726001666,0.057971014492753624,0.03918907598224009,3.101458856857517,3.5575046411334634,0,0,1.1989391329014678,6.195275579814116,9.182482490393229,1.3060968234186334,7.2984609363428605,-1.1763949413375812,,-2.310571399437667,-1.7638901842370367,-0.35179747619285645,-0.525357259564077,-0.21368387519686632,0.44072673448417143,0.38896687417208864,1.2536807063468887,0.21784907268320539,0.8112241929920881,0.6831137088997317,1.4098147109026906,0.246477640490758,1.31799320995512,1.304707600199919,1.3126832752064386,0.55483479364347,0.42377850456410265,0.46346084796605264,0.4095742977174424,0.2072133776621675,0.2538451043060254,0.38652449655332555,0.22234800098776356,0.24679505372649568,1.3746200228891918,0.5798069045655164,0.6311245070404147,0.11297924352175388,-0.7036467047165409,-0.09362589514149502,,,1.0549106514682702,-1.2019793817717006,-0.44441040253090885,0,3.174642331225138
9,no_148.txt,"Renton School District immunization rate on the increase
District-wide immunization rate greater than 90 percent; H.O.M.E. program has lower percentage as does small private school
Nearly all of the schools, public and private, in the Renton School District are showing greater than 90 percent coverage for immunizations for last school year, according to King County Public Health.
The only school that did not send in a vaccination exemption report for the 2013-14 school year was the Northwest Free School, a private elementary school. An administrator for that school with a class size of just three children said that paperwork was forthcoming.
This years immunization coverage in Renton is looking even better, according to Randy Matheson, district spokesperson. The only school that reported less coverage last year was the districts Homeschool Opportunities for Merging Education program or H.O.M.E. program. That school reported 50 to 70 percent immunization coverage for the 2013-14 school year.
The numbers you saw were from the 2013-2014 school year and are improving this year, mainly due to better tracking of this information by the new office manager at the H.O.M.E. program, said Matheson. That being said, parents have many reasons to choose to, or not to immunize their children, including health, personal or religious reasons.
District policy allows for exemptions from immunization requirements due to health, personal or religious reasons only as allowed for by state law.
Lara Randolph is a parent of two students in the H.O.M.E. program, who has a philosophical objection to getting her children vaccinated. Shes not convinced vaccines wont cause more damage than the actual disease theyre inoculating.
So my fear is not measles; my fear is the vaccination of the measles, said Randolph. Im more afraid of that than the actual childhood disease. Because my children are not (immune-compromised) in any other way, a normal childhood disease is not scary to me.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that the measles in its more serious effects can lead to ear infection, pneumonia, seizures, brain damage and even death.
Yet Randolph and another H.O.M.E. program mother, who wished not to be named, are fearful of the vaccine. Both say they have experienced adverse reactions to vaccines, either personally or with their children, and that makes up some of their objections. Neither of Randolphs children have been vaccinated for any disease and one of the other mothers three children are vaccinated against some diseases.
We vaccinated as young parents and as we began to ask more questions and gather more information we backed off more and more until we came to the same conclusion that Lara has come to, said the H.O.M.E parent.
She went on to describe her fear.
So you most commonly hear in the media about the risk of death and encephalitis from the measles, said the mom. What you do not hear is that the measles vaccine also carries a risk of death and encephalitis.
She points to numbers shes found with the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a voluntary reporting system maintained by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration to back up her claim. Anyone can submit reports to the VAERS Database and reports do not necessarily prove the adverse event was caused by a vaccine.
The mothers are also leery because of the existence of a federal court to settle vaccine claims. Its called the Office of Special Masters and it is part of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.
If they (vaccines) are 100 percent safe why do we have a need to legally protect the people that manufacture, require and administer them, said the H.O.M.E. program mom.
Shes tired of parents who support vaccine choice being labeled paranoid, superstitious, ignorant and lunatics. She said that she feels like her family has to stay underground to preserve the safety of her family.
Its really not any fun to sit around and wonder if someone is going to call Child Protective Services, she said.
Randolph echoed her sentiments, which is a real fear because theres such a hysteria about not vaccinating people believe that youre not taking care of your children, if you dont vaccinate, which is like ridiculous.
On its website, the CDC states that the risk of serious harm, or death from the measles vaccine is extremely small. Vaccinations also help create a herd immunity that helps prevent the disease from getting to patients who for medical reasons cannot receive the vaccination.
Renton-area schools report an immunization rate of 90 percent from 2013-2014 for all but one school and while 90 percent is respectable there is still room for improvement, said Dr. Callie Byrd, via email.
She is a pediatrician in Valley Medicals Covington Clinic South and still urges everyone to speak to their health-care provider about making sure their immunizations are up to date.
Communities with areas of unvaccinated or under-vaccinated individuals are at an increased risk for outbreaks of diseases that can be prevented with vaccines, as we have seen with the recent measles outbreak, she said.
Byrd points to the U.S. governments vaccination goals, Healthy People 2020, which strives for a 90 percent vaccination rate for children 19-35 month and a 95 percent vaccination rate for all children entering kindergarten.
Byrd reports that for each child vaccinated according to the recommended immunization schedule, 33,000 lives are saved, preventing 14 million cases of disease and reducing health care costs by $9.9 billion.

10,no_158.txt,"Some bed net-vaccine combinations may worsen malaria: Research
Washington: Joint use of bed nets and vaccines will not always lead to consistent increases in the efficacy of malaria control, and sometimes their use may actually make the situation worse, a new study suggests.
""The joint use of bed nets and vaccines will not always lead to consistent increases in the efficacy of malaria control,"" said Mercedes Pascual, a professor in the University of Michigan Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.
""In some cases, the use of vaccines and bed nets may actually make the situation worse,"" said Pascual. ""Specifically, our study suggests that the combined use of some malaria vaccines with bed nets can lead to increased morbidity and mortality in older age classes,"" said Pascual.
 
The malaria vaccines under development fall into three categories, each focusing on a different stage of the malaria life cycle. That cycle involves human hosts and Anopheles mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium parasites.
Preerythrocytic vaccines, or PEVs, aim to reduce the chances that a person will be infected when bitten by a disease-carrying mosquito.
 
Blood-stage vaccines, or BSVs, don't block infection but try to reduce the level of disease severity and the number of fatalities.
Transmission-blocking vaccines, or TBVs, don't protect vaccinated individuals against infection or illness. But they prevent mosquitoes from spreading the disease to others after biting a vaccinated person.
""Ironically, the vaccines that work best with bed nets are the ones that do not protect the vaccinated host - the bed net does that - but instead block transmission of malaria in mosquitoes that have found an opportunity to bite vaccinated hosts,"" Artzy-Randrup said.
 
Interactions between the bed nets and those vaccine reduced levels of natural immunity in the population, increasing morbidity in older age classes.
The research was published in the journal PNAS.

A major California insurer isnt waiting for reluctant parents to vaccinate their kids for measlesits getting on the phone to urge them to do so.
Spurred by a troubling outbreak of measles traced to Disneyland in California, the Kaiser Permanente health care system is reportedly launching a wave of robo-calls to members around the state who havent yet vaccinated their kids.
Read MoreMeasles near critical point
Nearly 90 people in seven states and Mexico have been infected in the measles outbreak, including 30 babies that have been placed in isolation near San Francisco. The vast majority of cases occurred in people who werent vaccinated, and the outbreak has spurred renewed debate over the controversial practice by some parents to avoid vaccinating their children.
California has a number of areas with high rates of unvaccinated kids, according to the Los Angeles Daily News, which reported the robo-call plan by Kaiser Permanante, which both sells health plans and operates hospitals and doctors offices.
We have a sizable, affluent, educated population who have done their research and have made their decision that they are against the vaccine, Dr. Margaret Stone, chief of pediatric medicine at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Woodland Hills, told the newspaper.
Stone said that the measles outbreak has provided us with an opportunity to bring up the discussion of how, when you have a sizable number of unvaccinated children, these illnesses can take hold of that population and spread like wildfire.

Another physician, Dr. Jayvee Regala, told the Daily News, I think the problem is theres no fear of measles right now.
In 2000, a half a million died of measles worldwide and people here dont see it, said Regala, a pediatrician with Facey Medical Group in Northridge, California.

THE number of measles cases in the United States has been dramatically rising recently, leading some states to consider enforced vaccinations.

IT IS the outbreak that started at the happiest place on Earth, but has led to an eruption of anger around the world.
An outbreak of measles, traced back to the Disneyland theme park in California, has sparked a storm of controversy over the anti-vaccination movement, which continues to hold sway in the US and Australia.
The latest figures from the US show that 121 people have contracted measles since December 28, all but 18 of whom have been linked to Disneyland.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the outbreak likely started from a traveller who became infected overseas and then visited the amusement park.
But the flare-up has caused a firestorm of controversy in the States, with politicians, doctors and media outlets combining to demonise the anti-vaccination movement.

The angry reaction reached its peak this week when a Canadian mother Jennifer Hibben-White published a scathing attack of anti-vaxxers on her Facebook page.
She explained how her son Griffin, a newborn who is too young to receive vaccines, may have contracted measles from another patient in a doctors office.
Im angry. Angry as hell, she wrote on the post, which has now been shared more than 240,000 times.
If you have chosen to not vaccinate yourself or your child, I blame you. I blame you.
You have stood on the shoulders of our collective protection for too long. From that high height, we have given you the PRIVILEGE of our protection, for free. And in return, you gave me this week. A week from hell. Wherein I dont know if my BABY will develop something that has DEATH as a potential outcome. DEATH.
Look at Griffin. Tell me why he gets to bear the brunt of your stupidity and reckless abuse of our protection. Tell me.

WHAT DOES THE ANTI-VAXXER MOVEMENT BELIEVE?
Despite strong evidence of its overwhelming benefits, many parents elect not to immunise their children because they feel it is unnatural. There are also prevalent fears about a link between vaccination and autism. A story on news.com.au yesterday on the issue attracted hundreds of comments, with many sharing unfounded concerns that vaccines can kill and cause cancer.
The Australian Vaccination Skeptics Network argues that vaccines, like all medical procedures, can carry with them the possibility of serious injury or death.
It argues that vaccinations have been linked to causing autism, and that vaccinated people still contract diseases designed to protect them.
The organisation has been widely discredited (more on this later) and, in 2012, the NSW Government ordered the organisation change its name from the Australian Vaccination Network because it was deemed misleading and deceptive.

Australians successfully campaigned to stop American anti-vaccination campaigner Sherri Tenpenny from entering the country last month.
The controversial doctor, who argues that vaccines have a negative impact on health, cancelled her speaking tour of Australia citing security concerns.
She said that pro-vaccine extremists had made continual, anonymous threats of vandalism and violence.

SO, DOES VACCINATION CAUSE AUTISM?
A study led by the University of Sydney last year definitively settled the argument.
The review of 1.25 million children the available data from around the world found that there was no link between vaccination and the development of autism or autism spectrum disorders.
The study examined seven sets of data and concluded that there was no evidence to support a relationship between common vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough and the development of autism.
The data consistently shows the lack of evidence for an association between autism, autism spectrum disorders and childhood vaccinations providing no reason to avoid immunisation on these grounds, Associate Professor Guy Eslick of the Sydney Medical School, told news.com.au at the time.

The idea that vaccines were linked to autism took hold in 1998 when British gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield published a paper that hypothesised that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine could lead to the condition.
The paper has since been discredited and his research was found to be fraudulent.
In 2011, pharmaceutical scientist Dr Dennis Flaherty called Wakefields findings the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years.
AND A WORD FROM A DOCTOR
Dr Tass James is a Sydney GP and has been vaccinating kids for 38 years. He says in all of this time he has never seen one serious complication from a vaccine.
Vaccines have almost eradicated so many diseases diseases which were childhood killers 40 years ago are almost non existent now.
If a significant number of people stop vaccinating children, these conditions will reappear in our society.
Its unfortunate some anti-vaxxers say that vaccines cause autism and cancer. There is absolutely no evidence this is true, and those claims may frighten some nervous parents about vaccinating their kids.
ANTI-VAXXER FIRESTORM THROWS UP THE GOOD AND THE BAD
The US discussion around the anti-vaccination movement has thrown up the good and the bad on either side of the persistent argument.
The discussion has put renewed focus on a book by Queensland author Stephanie Messenger entitled Melanies Marvellous Measles.
The book has a strong anti-vaccination message, with a mother telling her child at one point that for most children it is a good thing to get measles and telling her it would be a great idea to deliberately catch it.
This book actually exists. Source: Supplied
People have taken to the comments section of online retailer Amazon to mock the book.
One tongue-in-cheek commenter, Seabisquick, asked why there wasnt a braille version of the title: My infant daughter went blind after contracting measles from an unvaccinated child, and yet theres no braille version of this wonderful book for me to give her some day to explain to her how awesome the disease that took her sight away is.
And there was this from Sandra Bradley: As a carpenter who specialises in itty bitty coffins I cant say enough good things about this book, my customer base has been growing at an epidemic rate!
The discussion has also resurfaced a touching open letter by the late childrens author Roald Dahl, whose daughter Oliva died after contracting measles.
The letter, which was written in 1988, reads in part:
Olivia, my eldest daughter, caught measles when she was seven years old. As the illness took its usual course I can remember reading to her often in bed and not feeling particularly alarmed about it. Then one morning, when she was well on the road to recovery, I was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldnt do anything.
Are you feeling all right? I asked her.
I feel all sleepy, she said.
In an hour, she was unconscious. In twelve hours she was dead.
I was unable to do that for Olivia in 1962 because in those days a reliable measles vaccine had not been discovered. Today a good and safe vaccine is available to every family and all you have to do is to ask your doctor to administer it. It is not yet generally accepted that measles can be a dangerous illness. Believe me, it is. In my opinion parents who now refuse to have their children immunised are putting the lives of those children at risk.

Meanwhile, a report that people in California were holding measles parties so children could naturally build up their immunity to the disease has since been found to be false.
SHOULD CHILDREN BE FORCED TO VACCINATE?
As the US struggles with the measles epidemic, doctors, politicians and media outlets have argued that vaccinations should be forced on all children before they attend school.
Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, a former primary school principal, last week announced her intention to introduce legislation to mandate that made vaccinations mandatory.
Senator Barbara Boxer, meanwhile, wants to close a loophole in Californian regulations that allows parents to opt out of vaccine requirements for their childs school and daycare.
While a small number of children cannot be vaccinated due to an underlying medical condition, we believe there should be no such thing as a philosophical or personal belief exemption, since everyone uses public spaces, she said.
As we have learned in the past month, parents who refuse to vaccinate their children not only put their own family at risk, but they also endanger other families who choose to vaccinate.
The discussion is an interesting one because forcing children to vaccinate is at odds with the concept of individual choice and freedom, which US politicians hold highly.

Measles is a highly contagious, potentially fatal disease that affects mostly children.
Symptoms include fever, runny nose, bloodshot eyes, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. A rash later develops, starting on the face and spreading downwards.
In extreme cases, the disease can cause lead to blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhoea, ear infection and pneumonia and death.

13,no_162.txt,"Debunking vaccine junk science won't change people's minds. Here's what will.
We know that vaccines aren't a partisan issue. There are pro- and anti-vaxxers on both sides of the political spectrum. Even the science-minded President has, at times, equivocated on the issue. But as the vaccine debate took on a political pitch this week with Republicans firing back at Obama's suggestion that parents ""get your kids vaccinated"" how and why people believe what they do about immunizations was on the minds of many.
I called Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth who specializes in the sometimes magical thinking people have in politics and health care. In a study on perceptions of flu shots, he found correcting myths had the opposite of the desired effect on the most vaccine-skeptical among us. In another study on the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, he found that myth-busting actually increased some parents' wariness about the shot. In his political research, he has demonstrated that giving people corrective information can deepen their misperceptions findings that dishearten any debunker.
Here's our interview about why it's so hard to get people to change their minds about vaccines, why corrective information fails, and how to prevent vaccine denialism in the first place. What follows has been lightly edited for clarity.
Julia Belluz: If I had to briefly sum up your research findings, I'd say: it's near impossible to change peoples' minds. Are vaccine beliefs any different from other types of beliefs?
Brendan Nyhan: Vaccine beliefs are a lot like the political beliefs my co-author [Jason Reifler] and I study. People feel passionately, they are not inclined to hear contradictory messages, and there are all sorts of myths circulating. The way people reason about vaccines, it's the same as the way people reason about other controversial topics.
VACCINES ARE A VICTIM OF THEIR OWN SUCCESS HERE.
JB: And yet the evidence on the benefits of vaccines is overwhelming. Why is it so hard to get some parents on side?
BN: The benefit is not tangible in any way. It's not a case where your child is sick, you get a medicine, they get better, and you can see it. With vaccines, your child is well, you give them a vaccine, they stay well. The only potential downside is the perspective of certain parents who focus on these myths about side effects. Thats really tough.
Thats part of the reason vaccines historically have been so controversial. It goes back to the very first vaccines, not just the MMR-autism scare in 1998. People have always been suspicious of vaccines. There has always been an instinctive response to the idea of using a disease to protect yourself against the disease. It gives people the heebie jeebies. Finally, many of the diseases that vaccines prevent today are essentially invisible in the US. Vaccines are a victim of their own success here.
JB: Who most influences parents' thinking about vaccination?
BN: Parents rate their childs doctor as their most-trusted source on vaccines by far. For all the coverage of Jenny McCarthy, parents tell us their pediatrician is who they trust and listen to. Thats why providers are so important. For similar reasons, we should promote vaccines from the bottom up within communities that are at risk of not getting vaccinated.
FOR ALL THE COVERAGE OF JENNY MCCARTHY, PARENTS TELL US THEY LISTEN TO THEIR PEDIATRICIAN.
During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, there was a moment when the medical teams were trying to fight the epidemic by communicating the science of how to prevent the spread of the diseases. But they werent trusted. When they started working with community leaders and using those leaders in turn to work with people within communities, thats when they started changing peoples' practices.
In the US, most places have very good levels of vaccination. The US doesn't have a vaccine crisis. We have pockets of un- and under-vaccinated people that create potential hotspots. It's important to be targeted in our approach. In all those places where people are vaccinating, we don't want to scare them.
JB: You've written about the ""backfire effects"" of being too hard in trying to convince people to see another point of view. How does that relate to vaccines and how should we address the vaccine-hesitant?
BN: My co-authors and I have found that corrective information about controversial issues like vaccines is often ineffective and can even have counterproductive effects. In this case, we found that debunking myths about the MMR vaccine and the flu shot can make people who have the least positive views of vaccines less likely to intend to vaccinate rather than more.
A better approach is to help healthcare providers communicate more effectively. There are too many providers who are too accommodating in their language about alternative schedules or selective vaccination. When my son was born, we went to a pediatric practice in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and the first thing they said to us was: 'We're willing to work with you on vaccines.' I interpreted that as meaning, 'Were open to negotiating vaccines with you.' We said, 'No, no, we want everything.' But the danger is that if thats your opening offer as a doctor, parents may take it.
JB: How does the language doctors use impact whether people vaccinate their kids or not?
BN: Studies have found that providers who use presumptive language, saying, 'Its time for some shots,' are much more likely to have successful vaccine compliance than providers who use participatory language like, 'What do you think about shots?' It's of course important to respect patient autonomy but I think, at the same time, the language providers use gives patients a cue about the strength of the medical evidence.
If you roll into the emergency room on a stretcher with a gun shot wound, no one says, 'How do you feel about getting bullets out of you?' They say, 'We need to get this out of you now.' There is a move in medicine toward participatory approaches in contexts in which the benefits are less clear. But this is an area where the science is very clear and the language we use should reflect that.
WE NEED TO CREATE CONDITIONS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE AS MANY MINDS ABOUT VACCINES IN FIRST PLACE.
JB: There's a movement that seems to be bubbling up in the US: the ""vaccine delayers."" These parents who don't quite refuse vaccines, but they opt for alternative vaccine schedules, delaying some shots and skipping others. What do you make of it?
BN: Its a tough issue because a certain group of parents are used to being in charge of their kids' healthcare and customizing their own personal healthcare in a way that seems consistent with alternative vaccine schedules. People have an idea that they know what their child needs and what their child is ready for. But federal schedules are based on the best-available science. Making up your own is just delaying protecting your kid. The danger is they increase the amount of time kids are at risk for these diseases.
JB: Knowing that it's hard to change peoples' minds, how do you deal with vaccine denialism?
BN: The best approach is to create conditions where you don't have to change as many minds in first place. We should protect the social consensus around vaccination and prevent it from being politicized, from turning into a partisan debate between Chris Christie and Rand Paul on one hand and Obama on the other. That would be the fastest way to squander the gains we have made and create conditions where some of these diseases could return.

14,no_165.txt,"8 Eye-Opening Facts About Vaccines
In 2000, measles was eradicated in the United States, but has recently re-emerged and infected over 100 people in at least 14 states. Many doctors point to parents not vaccinating their children as the reason the virus is now spreading in the United States. Though the vast majority of Americans believe that the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks, some parents have opted out of vaccinating their children because of personal or religious reasons. Some point to a debunked link to vaccinations causing autism in children, however, earlier this week, the autism advocacy group, Autism Speaks urged parents to have their children vaccinated.
Below are 8 eye-opening facts about vaccines
Currently, Mississippi and West Virginia are the only states which do not allow parents to opt out of vaccinating their children because of religious or personal beliefs.
92% of Doctors Say Measles Outbreak Due to Parents Not Vaccinating
Additionally, 79% of doctors believe unvaccinated children shouldn't be allowed in schools.
Tanzania Does Better Than U.S.
As noted by West Virginia Public Broadcasting, many poor countries have much higher vaccination rates than the United States. Tanzania for example, a country ranked 200th out of 228 countries in terms of GDP per capita, has a 99% vaccination rate. Only 91% of Americans have received the measles vaccination.
Younger Americans more skeptical about vaccines
Perhaps it's because millennials have grown up in a world without some of the diseases that previous generations experienced. Regardless, according to a recent YouGov survey, 21% of Americans 18-29 years old believe early childhood vaccinations can cause autism.
133 California School Districts have MMR Vaccination Rates of 80% or Lower
As shown above in this Silk visualization above, according to CDC data, in more than 100 California, 80% or less have received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Another visualization shows that 22 school districts actually have vaccination rates under 50%.
More than 20 Million People are Infected with Measles Each Year
Each year, more than 20 million people are infected with measles and over 140,000 people die from the virus. This is because it is extremely hard to vaccinate everyone in poor and hard to reach areas. In 2000, measles was eliminated from the United States.
Immunization Prevents Between 2-3 Million Deaths Every Year
The World Health Organization (WHO) points out that immunization prevents two to three million deaths each year from diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, and measles.
99% Reduction in Bacterial Meningitis Cases
According to the CDC, there has been a 99% reduction bacterial meningitis cases caused by Haemophilus influenzae since the vaccine was introduced in 1988.

15,no_170.txt,"Flu Vaccine Only Protects 1 In 4 This Season Says The CDC
A recent study released by the CDC regarding seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness found the chemical cocktail concocted to battle this years strain to be only 23 percent effective; in other words it will protect less than 1 in 4 people.
Its lack of punch is being blamed on multiple strains of the H3N2 virus that are circulating and making people sick, but that were not included in this seasons vaccine, reports Agence France-Press.
Thats one of the worst performances in the last decade according to the Associated Press. In the best flu seasons, the vaccines were 50 to 60 percent effective.
AFP has a breakdown of how the vaccine performed in different age groups, noting that it mostly helped younger, healthier people:
This season, vaccine effectiveness has been highest 26 percent in those aged six months through 17 years.
Vaccine effectiveness was just 12 percent for ages 18 to 49 years and 14 percent for people age 50 years and older, the CDC said.
Last month, the CDC also issued an advisory to physicians warning that this seasons flu vaccine was an incompatible match for the circulating Influenza A (H3N2) strain, meaning the agency knew shots which 145.4 million people received were doing little to nothing in the way of fighting the flu.
However, despite the lousy odds of it actually doing anything to combat the flu, the CDC and its mainstream media propaganda parrots have still gone on to promote vaccination, ludicrously blaming flu outbreaks on people who refuse to inject themselves with vaccines known to contain toxic adjuvants such as thimerosal, a mercury-containing compound.
Instead, the public gets watered down headlines that try to put a positive spin on the 23 percent figure, like this one from NPR: This Years Flu Vaccine Is Pretty Wimpy, But Can Still Help, and this one from the Washington Post: CDC: Flu Vaccine Only 23 Percent Effective This Season, But Still Better Than Nothing.
Notice the articles contain no mention of the scores of victims that incur life-altering, and sometimes lethal, adverse reactions as a result of taking the shot, such as three-year-old Ayzlee McCarthy, an Iowa tot that died soon after receiving an injection.
Or the numerous lives lost during the clinical trial phases of vaccine development, like the 23 who died after receiving high doses of the Fluzone vaccine, up from only 7 deaths earlier this year.
No matter what vaccination choices you make for yourself or your family, there is a basic human right to be fully informed about all risks and have the ability to refuse to allow substances you consider to be harmful, toxic or poisonous to be forced upon you, writes Dr. Joseph Mercola. Unfortunately, the partnership between government health agencies and vaccine manufacturers is getting closer and closer. There is a lot of discrimination against Americans, who want to be free to exercise their human right to informed consent when it comes to making voluntary decisions about which vaccines they and their children use.

16,no_175.txt,"Flu vaccine rates low among nursing home workers
HealthDay News Although prior research indicates that patients living in nursing homes may be at an unnecessarily high risk of contracting influenza, only about one in two nursing home workers in the United States receive an annual flu vaccine, according to a study published in the American Journal of Infection Control.
Although approximately three-quarters (72%) of nursing home residents receive the seasonal influenza vaccine annually, the vaccine offers limited protection in older and immunocompromised patients, noted Jill D. Daugherty, MPH, PhD, of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and colleagues.
To determine influenza vaccination rates and attitudes toward the vaccine among nursing home employees, the investigators surveyed 1,965 employees in Florida, Georgia, and Wisconsin in 2011 and 2012.
Many nursing home workers have mistaken beliefs about the flu and vaccination, reported the study authors. Nearly 40% incorrectly thought the vaccine could cause the flu. Workers who knew that wasnt true were 12% more likely to get vaccinated. Those who believed that vaccination was effective were 28% more likely to get vaccinated.
Vaccination rates would be higher if staff held accurate beliefs about vaccination and influenza, concluded the researchers.
Our findings support the need for additional research on the use of incentives and educational strategies targeted at staff.",7,10,24.6,0,0.8165915144814385,0.641186206208335,0.08733291569210234,0.08082039299465361,0.1,0.3267017525310318,0.32318044528675577,0.134585806640026,0.29517181473710236,0.20599060971289873,0.19776606579311193,0.1045984692963553,0.2063892299457202,0.06646002330368266,0.4935492810127804,0.1032802072838297,0.13824122463700173,1.165563593065839,0.23387411481309398,0.15678490723039795,1.3466420281474358,0.2664173329178503,0.15831716752200706,1.3429727055167762,0.2695332641841794,0.043209876543209874,0.015873015873015872,0,0.04666666666666667,3.174444689105751,3.5502740582490464,0,0,1.2479668271803104,7.247018088029324,9.699883492793719,-0.9162334739533726,-0.9964653894146157,0.43072934532495194,,1.5807440012732195,1.768566717852472,-1.3105872573514414,-1.3638199623855165,-0.3862388663476518,-1.4679561644538326,-1.2943923441438545,-0.9860403244957825,-0.048695799353746905,-0.4902481053558629,0.07416500423738147,-0.46960738880808606,0.8592982502977627,-0.6958847672625919,-0.8903752470717369,-0.8313014153931988,0.5474707058856388,0.5531186578500905,0.5537423281118466,-0.07073718095889638,0.23226162829753927,-0.07523409789031188,0.0626141621380845,0.15403807769735767,0.20862664673659204,0.4439262620720441,-0.5379918162621243,-1.1385573984231125,0.5234771151442356,0.3310761782537382,-0.21242697116732692,,,2.0626926924795357,2.2110966209464418,1.367475497110245,0,-7.708730399182416
17,no_180.txt,"Students raise concerns over Queen's professors anti-vaccine teachings
A professor at Queens University is under fire from students who allege she teaches anti-vaccination information as fact in her classes, according to the student government.
In HLTH 102, Physical Determinants of Health, Melody Torcolacci teaches information about vaccines and health that has been widely refuted by medical experts but is presented as truth, students told the student governments academic affairs commissioner.
Its clear to say the students are very, very upset, said Colin Zarzour, the Alma Mater Societys academic affairs commissioner.
Zarzour was alerted to the material on Tuesday, when he was approached by a residence don whose students were concerned about the material being taught in their class.
Since then, Zarzour has spoken with former and current students who also said the anti-vaccine material is taught in the class, he said.
The class is offered through the universitys department of kinesiology and health studies.
Zarzour said he spoke with the head of the universitys of kinesiology and health studies department on Tuesday. He was told they were aware of the issue and would have a conversation with Torcolacci, a continuing adjunct professor.
Torcolacci did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Toronto Star.
The course description states, HLTH 102 looks at some of the many physical determinants of health beyond the obvious factors of physical activity, nutrition, and stress management. The course summary says vaccines and health will be covered in the class.
Lecture slides sent to the Star and posted online, which appear to be from the class, ask the question, Vaccines Good or Bad?
No scientific evidence exists showing vaccines are NOT contributing to increased incidents of chronic illness and disability in children, reads one slide.
Queens University Principal Daniel Woolf sent out two tweets responding to the controversy Wednesday.
I am aware of the situation regarding HLTH 102 and have asked the provost to work with Arts and Science to gather more information, he tweeted, which was followed up with, Re: HLTH 102: I encourage people to be respectful and patient, and to reserve judgment until the facts are known.
University Provost Alan Harrison told the Star he was aware of the flurry of social media attention on the issue tweets on the issue were tagged with #antivaxprof but had not received complaints from students.
We have certain expectations of our faculty members. Those expectations are that the available scientific evidence will be presented objectively, comprehensively, and that if the individual doing the presentation had biases, those biases should be declared, said Harrison.
Harrison said he was looking into the issues regarding Torcolacci but did not yet have a full picture of the issue. He said he had not yet spoken with Torcolacci as of Wednesday afternoon.
Harrison said Queens does not have a position on being for or against vaccines.
We want our students to think for themselves. Sometimes in order to do that, there may be some provocative material but its the context in which thats presented that is critical, he said.
The news comes as Toronto experiences an outbreak of measles with four cases confirmed and more expected.
Isabelle Duchaine, a former student and former student government academic affairs commissioner, said she received complaints from three students in the 2012/2013 school year about anti-vaccine material in Torcolaccis classes.
She said she didnt follow up on the issue but directed the students to speak to their department head a decision she now regrets.
Duchaine said a current student in the class recently sent her the class slides. She called the material pseudoscience.
It is a question about academic quality but it goes into other issues of public health as well, she said.
Dr. Shelley Deeks, medical director with immunization and vaccine preventable disease for Public Health Ontario said if misinformation is being spread it is absolutely concerning.
Medical experts widely decry anti-vaccine proponents who spread information that has been medically proven to be untrue. Notably, celebrities such as Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey have publicly said they believe vaccines are linked to autism.
The medical journal that once published a report purporting to link vaccines with autism has since retracted the piece. The author of the report, Andrew Wakefield, has since been stripped of his medical licence.
Zarzour said he wants to see the course content undergo academic review.

18,no_182.txt,"Assemblyman Abinanti Sponsors Vaccination Exemption Bill
Currently, 19 states have vaccination exemptions based on philosophical reasons.
Assemblyman Thomas Abinanti (D-Greenburgh/Mount Pleasant) has co-sponsored a bill in Albany that would give parents the opportunity to exempt their children from vaccinations.
The proposed bill, number A00943, would allow parents to not vaccinate their children based on philosophical grounds. Those children could still attend school provided the parents make their objection known on a form. Such exemptions are allowed in 19 states, according to Capital New York.
The bill comes at a time when 14 states have reported measles outbreaks, and national advocacy group Autism Speaks is recommending parents vaccinate their children. Some parents over the past 15 years had stopped vaccinating their children, pointing to a now debunked study that vaccinations were linked to autism, according to ABC News.
""Over the last two decades, extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism,"" said Rob Ring, Chief Science Officer for Autism Speaks, in a statement. ""The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause autism. We urge that all children be fully vaccinated.""
One of the 19 states that has a philosophical exemption, California, is now considering ending that option, in part because of the measles outbreak, writes Long Beach Patch.
""I've personally witnessed the suffering caused by these preventable diseases and I am very grateful to the many parents that are now speaking up and letting us know that our current laws don't protect their kids,"" said California state Sen. Richard Pan, who is also a pediatrician.
Referred to as the ""philosophical exemption to immunizations act,"" the New York proposal states the following:
In the event that a person in parental relation to a child makes application for admission of such child to a school or has a child attending school and there exists no certificate or other acceptable evidence of the child's immunization against poliomyelitis, mumps, measles, diphtheria, rubella, varicella, hepatitis B, pertussis, tetanus, and, where applicable, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcal disease, the principal, teacher, owner or person in charge of the school shall inform such person of the necessity to have the child immunized, that such immunization may be administered by any health practitioner, or that the child may be immunized without charge by the health officer in the county where the child resides, if such person executes a consent therefor AND PROVIDE A FORM CITING OTHER OPTIONS OF COMPLIANCE AS NOTED IN THIS SECTION. In the event that such person does not wish to select a health practitioner to administer the immunization, [he or she shall be provided with a form which] THE PROVIDED FORM shall give notice that as a prerequisite to processing the application for admission to, or for continued attendance at, the school such person shall state a valid reason for withholding consent, OR CHECK A FIXED STATEMENT PRE-PRINTED ON THE FORM INDICATING HIS OR HER PERSONAL OBJECTION TO IMMUNIZATIONS, MEDICAL TESTING AND TREATMENTS or consent shall be given for immunization to be administered by a health officer in the public employ, or by a school physician or nurse.
Abinanti's office did not immediately reply to a request for comment about the proposed legislation, but he told Capital New York that the risk is potentially too great to force parents to vaccinate their children.
""I believe that it is the right of parents to determine who invades the body of their children and the logic that says the state can determine that a foreign substance can invade a child means that anything can invade the child no matter how dangerous,"" said Abinanti, whose son has autism.
He continued his remarks to Capital New York, ""I believe that the family, with the doctor, should make the individual determination whether a particular vaccine is appropriate for that child. There are many of us who resent our kids being collateral damage. The possible adverse effects, whatever they may be, and it may be a very small minoritybut [the state is] discarding a group of people, which is now a growing group of people.""",13,21,37.523809523809526,0,0.7087328590452671,0.48529319184876624,0.1842361488021337,0.1825392708564416,0.7142857142857143,0.39484417056089005,0.33581348246212506,0.18684237567157214,0.3025214949672814,0.19633810651758987,0.17147173662004117,0.10605252716373394,0.1580678924722115,0.08206356002604889,0.6880928838821693,0.13893405728379254,0.13086175948962264,1.1135834298792409,0.2239094684661987,0.14843915752655035,1.2923881788704923,0.25805801425854763,0.15185087327576444,1.2998347631690068,0.2600607978317041,0.0205078125,0.02104192104192104,0.011235955056179775,0.02746566791510612,3.101008510047012,3.5074369884737133,0,0,1.18572911656245,6.770551980500393,9.041913958754279,-0.3101433928519164,-0.5212352353347603,2.996515774328619,,0.663537445922888,0.531510764177304,-0.4332969678788932,-0.427009059137922,2.0468985575739773,0.3158956693249064,-0.8876103466032389,-0.4920667052996177,0.0686616272395757,-0.8039723552865728,-1.2614070820062275,-0.44482983060396586,-0.37480048834705215,-0.32188745461915197,-0.3195241394949905,-0.31375936272621946,0.23969257641827962,0.287777149093148,0.30195633013538936,-0.9548893743012771,-0.8562896471092389,-0.7913186303968709,-0.823118568173799,-0.8043489093606309,-0.7938785911876945,-0.30958929912889205,-0.364364421436625,-0.7955572538248445,-0.5306015919127243,-0.7100312883507642,-0.9162554265565809,,,0.7833739736018464,0.6648863793587168,-0.936667161269715,0,-0.0033413173082094128
19,no_192.txt,"'Tis the season for the flu
STAUNTON Retail isn't the only business seeing a December bump in activity. Valley hospitals and doctor's offices are flooding with sick patients as Virginia and the rest of the country experience an unusually severe flu season.
""Within the last two weeks, we've seen a dramatic increase in flu reporting for our district,"" said Jonathan Falk, District Epidemiologist of the Staunton-Augusta Health Dept. ""If our state mirrors the national trend, it's predominately the Influenza type A H3 virus.""
H3 viruses are among several strains that flu vaccines are designed to protect against. But, said Falk, a new H3 wrinkle appeared this season that the vaccines didn't anticipate.
""Generally, because of the time frame for producing the vaccines, they have to target the strain in January or February. It wasn't until late March that we started to see this new drift of H3,"" Falk explained.
In health care-speak, the H3 Texas strain is what was expected when the year's flu shots were formulated the variants are named for the place they were discovered, Falk said but we're being hit with a mutant H3 Switzerland strain instead.
Bottom line: While this year's flu vaccines cover some of the flu strains out there, they aren't as effective for what's ailing many people right now.
""One of my sisters-in-law has been hospitalized at RMH because of the flu,"" Priscilla Melchior told The News Leader by e-mail. ""I'm told that the emergency room is jammed and that medical staff members -- all wearing masks -- are slammed due to the volume of flu patients suffering with the dreaded A strain.""
""We've seen a significant uptick in the last two weeks in both flu A and flu B, said Dr. Rob Marble, emergency room medical director at Rockingham Memorial Hospital. ""A number of cases have required hospitalization, including very young and elderly patients.""
As of today, RMH is recommending masks for all visitors coming into the facility, reported hospital spokeswoman Jenn Downs.
Augusta Health, too, has had some critically ill and hospitalized patients, according to Dr. Allison Baroco, an infectious disease specialist at the hospital. ""There's no rhyme or reason of knowing when flu season will peak, and unfortunately, it's hitting now,"" Baroco said.
Due to the increasing flu cases, Augusta Health is asking visitors to wear masks on entering the hospital. The masks are available at the main entrances and on each of the inpatient nursing units.
Nationally, about 70 percent of the population is coming down with the H3 Switzerland form of Influenza A virus, Falk said. When H3 dominates, it's always a worse-than-usual flu season.
The burden is falling mostly on young people in our area, Barocco observed. But across the country, cases have spiked 500 percent in the past few weeks among people over 65, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports.
Despite the lesser effectiveness of this year's flu vaccines, both Baroco and Falk recommend them because they provide coverage for other flu strains that could hit later in the season.
""Prevention is the number one thing we're stressing,"" Falk said. In other words, wash your hands often. Don't send the kids to school if they're sick or try to be a hero by showing up sick at the office.
And skip the holiday party?
""Correct,"" Falk said. ""If you need it as an excuse, we support that.""",18,31,22.193548387096776,0,0.6204431841770808,0.3465145649453525,0.27577294657627743,0.2766248357516748,0.41935483870967744,0.3623076008815838,0.3360635738182084,0.232367345662134,0.35555056605929086,0.21066716704787553,0.18689767619321127,0.10220967809947436,0.17874972062412078,0.09296439924632591,0.8053672957527966,0.1602369990529555,0.1313562978030106,1.1407115987944887,0.22605168427804398,0.14883441694711552,1.2837672033557757,0.25572925596857315,0.14912046643350058,1.286552929580543,0.25652719509855304,0.031578947368421054,0.02857142857142857,0.04477611940298507,0.03555750658472344,3.2511351168197455,3.640160938005661,0,0,1.1993851276652567,6.704750910057582,9.225730465408347,0.19493167473263046,-0.08920782253489182,-0.04702768746525704,,-0.08725875333783883,-0.5697375974571584,0.3954095802863774,0.43950052969007924,0.8787005445883489,-0.5358560172951417,-0.879557440561486,-0.06172589634870779,0.9154134753592261,-0.33825132146600173,-0.4778748548708588,-0.5103130678914859,0.15340132413656993,-0.06060793533568245,0.024595260574437634,-0.004531377219206573,0.2603184719275973,0.426257462129967,0.3560856918095715,-0.9130154269588563,-1.0292612245523811,-0.9908071125761415,-1.1971211444818424,-1.0994287342821303,-1.1678524979729983,0.05787827508071792,-0.11144262582467719,0.22832377482670127,-0.08638330134643224,1.4183192501770345,1.2644467755819797,,,1.0640782356254046,0.45135117209335596,-0.29296037488432186,0,-2.574310787650173
20,no_2.txt,"Debunking Flu Shot Myths Makes Some Less Likely To Get Vaccinated
Only 42 percent of adults in the U.S. get their flu shots. A key reason for this low number is the misconception that you can catch the flu from the vaccine. But, a recent study found that, when vaccine-fearing patients heard the real facts from their doctors, they were actually more reluctant to get their flu shots.
The research, published in the current issue of the journal Vaccine, was conducted by two academicsDartmouth's Brendan Nyhan and the University of Exeter's Jason Reiflerwho have spent years documenting the ""backfire effect."" When our belief systems are challenged, some of us tend to double-down on our views to the point where contrary facts actually reinforce our perspectives. For instance, in a previous study, when Nyhan and Reifler provided participants with factual corrections of false statements made by George W. Bush about the war in Iraq and tax cuts, staunch conservatives were only more inclined to believe that what the president had said was true.
And now, it appears, we see a similar phenomenon among people who are extremely skeptical about vaccines. These patients, when given the facts about the flu vaccine, based on language drafted by the CDC, were less likely to believe the vaccination would give them the flubut they also were less likely to get their shots.
So, why would people make that choice even after they felt reassured about the vaccine's side effects? Nyhan tells the Washington Post that misperceptions about vaccines ""are more a consequence of people's mixed or negative attitudes towards vaccines, rather than the cause."" As a result, he explains, ""when we challenge one misperception, people may simply bring to mind other misconceptions or concerns that they have, and remind themselves of their more general concern about vaccines in the first place.""",5,12,29.25,0,0.6882865483110602,0.5766432662353371,0.4791114330291748,0.47917571862538655,0.08333333333333333,0.38092623348977117,0.34412278434015603,0.31228277878350735,0.3250394683571137,0.29440394929937413,0.23090896761815885,0.24118255028830995,0.24356058765670438,0.12302423541338565,1.073713364928167,0.21737608551613613,0.14062569345321593,1.2324530468771981,0.24478682530560258,0.1401162592022669,1.2274684533686162,0.24291257955836396,0.1395205663234029,1.2245128759327928,0.24403770653793094,0.15625,0.10714285714285714,0.08108108108108109,0.06827880512091039,3.043102975348164,3.4856650268775677,0,0,1.1331480165017747,6.476888389308448,9.012341251321901,-1.1182635009871913,-0.910059906854642,1.3539019495703757,,0.4896664648476387,1.2563999059571243,2.236286029048598,2.304954411282715,-0.4522542228106418,-0.04845209355978773,-0.6200520097447375,0.6937028748123496,0.4282216796996064,2.383349352671045,1.7575977415128623,1.8578240652340217,1.8086330175729837,0.6598888433765197,0.8120056330731463,0.8248848035214801,0.6469206439734023,0.8945671548569236,0.8294839456596222,-1.8366206829922493,-2.158841464831735,-2.0887223984444403,-2.512085390066396,-2.477760125544184,-2.4896600647792146,4.19589753228977,2.527830490007027,1.3366058071914153,1.7099203441316715,-1.530960226993881,-1.2739765821206148,,,-0.297449612275664,-0.2880998773916547,-1.040227787094446,0,5.483019043301003
21,no_20.txt,"Do llamas hold the secret to HIV vaccination?
The search for a vaccine against HIV has been frustrated by difficulties in generating a sufficient neutralising antibody response in humans to vaccine candidates. However, progress is being made by various innovative approaches including use of the unusual model animal, the llama. A new study in the journal PLOS Pathogens shows that immunised llamas produce a combination of neutralising antibodies that together destroy all members of a panel of 60 viruses.
Llamas are unusual in that in addition to the bulky two-light chain and two-heavy chain antibodies produced in other mammals including humans, they also produce heavy chain only antibodies (HCAbs). These are isolated as individual variable regions (VHH). Previous studies had shown that the VHH J3 was produced in llamas in response to immunisation with gp140 trimers of HIV. These trimers are cleaved, solubilised versions part of the HIV-1 Env protein, which is responsible for binding to CD4 on human cells and initiating infection. In the current study, the research team immunised a further two llamas with the aim of identifying further novel neutralising antibodies induced in response to immunisation.
Using a high-throughput screening method of more than 6000 clones, the researchers identified a further three neutralising HCAbs. These targeted different regions of the CD4-binding site and worked extra potently when used together to give 100% coverage against a panel of 60 viruses. The research team also carried out a method called deep sequencing of the HIV-binding regions of the antibodies. They found that these antibodies were only fully matured in response to immunisation. They were not detectable pre-immunisation or after only one vaccination round, but emerged after repeated exposure to the vaccine. The sequencing revealed that although all the antibodies have functional similarities, they have distinct sequences.
The results of this study are encouraging in the context of recent concepts in the field of HIV vaccine development which suggest the necessity of induction of multiple neutralising antibody lineages for production of an antibody-based vaccine and a potential need to combine purified monoclonal antibodies for therapy or prophylaxis. The neutralising antibodies produced in the immunised llamas were produced at low concentrations and would therefore not meet the criteria for a protective vaccine. However, the researchers point out that the generation of four broadly neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccination has not been achieved in any other species. Their results, they say, show that immunization can induce potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies in llamas with features similar to human antibodies, and provide a framework to analyze the effectiveness of immunization protocols.

22,no_23.txt,"Getting second pneumonia vaccine is now recommended
DEAR DOCTOR K: Im 70 years old. I already had a pneumonia vaccine, back when I was 65. At my checkup last week, my doctor said I need to get another one. Why?
DEAR READER: I always like to hear that adults are staying up to date with their vaccinations, as you did when you received a dose of the PPSV23 (Pneumovax) vaccine at age 65. Pneumovax helps protect against pneumonia caused by one common type of bacteria, called pneumococcus.
Pneumonia caused by pneumococcus bacteria can make people very sick, very fast. I know: It happened to me.
Without treatment, the pneumonia can become severe. The bacteria can also spread into the bloodstream or can cause meningitis, a serious infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.
Now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are advising adults age 65 and older to get a second vaccine to prevent bacterial pneumonia. The second vaccine, PCV13 (Prevnar 13), is expected to prevent many additional cases of pneumonia.
The PCV13 vaccine is not new. It has been included in childhood vaccinations for several years. But it is new for adults.
The CDC recommends a single dose of PCV13 for anyone who is older than 65. If you have the option, the CDC says it is best to get the PCV13 before the PPSV23. If you are getting the PCV13 first, wait a year between the two vaccines. If, as in your case, you have already received the PPSV23 vaccine, you can still get the PCV13 vaccine.
Vaccines are important for avoiding infection. But these vaccines protect only against specific bacteria. There are many other things you can, and should, do to reduce your risk of catching pneumonia caused by other bacteria and viruses. These measures will also protect you against a cold, the flu and many other infections.
The best way to protect yourself from infection is to wash your hands often with soap and warm water. Rub your hands together for a full 20 seconds. If you dont have access to soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Stay away from people you know are sick. If you are sick, stay home to avoid infecting others. At home, avoid kissing, hugging and sharing utensils with someone who is unwell.
When I caught pneumonia due to pneumococcus, I hadnt received the vaccine because I was not old enough. I was feeling great when I went to bed. When I got up the next morning, however, I felt very tired. When I looked in the mirror, I looked white as a ghost. I felt hot and had a high fever. I took myself to the emergency room and my blood pressure was very low: I was in shock.
Fortunately, prompt treatment turned me around and I was back in action a few days later. But I came close to dying. When it came time for me to get the vaccine, I surely did. I dont want that to happen ever again.

23,no_25.txt,"Seasonal Flu Vaccines Boost Immunity to Many Types of Flu Viruses
Seasonal flu vaccines may protect individuals not only against the strains of flu they contain but also against many additional types, according to a study published this week in mBio, the online open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology.
The work, directed by researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., found that some study participants who reported receiving flu vaccines had a strong immune response not only against the seasonal H3N2 flu strain from 2010, when blood samples were collected for analysis, but also against flu subtypes never included in any vaccine formulation.
The finding is exciting ""because it suggests that the seasonal flu vaccine boosts antibody responses and may provide some measure of protection against a new pandemic strain that could emerge from the avian population,"" says senior study author Paul G. Thomas, PhD, an associate member in the Department of Immunology at St. Jude. ""There might be a broader extent of reactions than we expected in the normal human population to some of these rare viral variants.""
Because avian influenza viruses have an important role in emerging infections, Thomas and colleagues tested whether exposure to different types of birds can elicit immune responses to avian influenza viruses in humans. They studied blood samples taken from 95 bird scientists attending the 2010 annual meeting of the American Ornithologist Union. They exposed plasma from the samples to purified proteins of avian influenza virus H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8 and H12 subtypes using two laboratory tests to see how many different viruses participants reacted to, and how strongly. The first test, ELISA, measures if any antibodies -- proteins produced by the body that are used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses - combine in any way to a protein called HA on the surface of the virus. The second, HAI, measures if antibodies can bind to HA and interrupt its association with a substance viruses use to get inside human cells.
In the ELISA tests, 77 percent of participants had detectable antibodies against avian influenza proteins. Most individuals tested had a strong antibody response to the seasonal H3N2 human virus-derived H3 subtype, part of that year's vaccine (2009-2010), but many also had strong measurable antibody responses to group 1 HA (avian H5, H6, H8, H12) and group 2 HA (avian H4, human H7) subtypes. Sixty-six percent of participants had some level of detectable antibodies against four or more HA proteins, and a few had responses to all subtypes tested, most of which have not previously been detected in the human population.
In additional experiments, the scientists found that participants who had significant antibody responses did not necessarily also have significant immune system T cell responses to avian viruses, indicating that these two arms of immunity can be independently boosted after vaccination or infection; that individuals who reported receiving seasonal influenza vaccination had significantly higher antibodies to the avian H4, H5, H6, and H8 subtypes; and that participants with exposure to poultry had significantly higher antibody responses to the H7 subtype, but to none of the other subtypes tested. Exposure to other types of birds did not play a role in immunity.
A person's immune response on the ELISA test did not necessarily predict response on the HAI test, and vice versa. As HAI antibodies only target the ""head"" of the HA while ELISA antibodies can be against the head or the relatively conserved ""stalk"" domain, this result indicated that some individuals were more likely to target the conserved stalk region (i.e. show greater reactivity in ELISA than in HAI).
The work has opened up a lot of questions in figuring out why people mount different types of responses, and potentially how the seasonal vaccine may play a role in boosting these responses, Thomas said. He has started additional studies in other groups of people with varied vaccination and infection histories to tease apart what exposures boost immunity against avian influenza viruses.
The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance (St. Jude CEIRS, contract HHSN272201400006C) and the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC), a fund-raising organization for the hospital.

24,no_32.txt,"Gates Foundation sponsors arts campaign to promote vaccination
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has commissioned a series of artworks by more than 30 artists as part of a campaign to promote vaccination.
The works are part of 'The Art of Saving a Life' campaign and consist of numerous pieces representing and stressing the importance of vaccines, such as a short story by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie reflecting on Nigeria in 1985, when a new health minister introduced free services for mothers and children.
Brazilian artist Vik Muniz also created a piece named 'Flowers The Beauty of Vaccines', which appears to be colourful flowers but upon closer inspection, represent liver cells infected with the smallpox vaccine virus.
The intention of the campaign is to promote vaccination in an international effort to raise money to vaccinate millions of people against deadly diseases, particularly in poorer nations.
Dr Christopher Elias, president of the global development programme at the Gate Foundation, told the New York Times: We want to get the buzz and the conversation going because it's easy to take these important lifesaving tools for granted.
The campaign, which was launched online on January 7, is the first time the Foundation has commissioned artists to promote a supported cause. The aim is for the images to be shared online via social media with the hashtag #VaccinesWork in order to encourage donations and discussion about the issue.
The project is timed to coincide with the upcoming meeting of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, an international public-private partnership in Berlin, which aims to raise $7.5bn to fund Gavi's next phase of vaccine development.",8,9,33.111111111111114,0,0.8987114354968071,0.7759519848558638,0.07205004245042801,0.07205004245042801,0.3333333333333333,0.43413229374324575,0.4167745126755673,0.06668279878795147,0.4650566168750326,0.2974595446687411,0.2105863187321219,0.03292241529561579,0.2701923594654848,0.018431027595090094,0.15758142612738896,0.03118457543788983,0.14531005499629293,1.2605801662253966,0.2480132589733115,0.14736134895401629,1.2795002467424934,0.2544024420237068,0.1484558446714284,1.2780158733570794,0.2546859544766113,0.015625,0.06666666666666667,0.058823529411764705,0.04201680672268908,3.1715618678124224,3.591991069962,0,0,1.1033890692640693,6.421293192918193,8.9975963931289,-0.8152184604364633,-1.0396681306946025,2.1204550677908895,,2.279073955188887,2.8379719731968236,-1.4489471021146891,-1.4445931697570904,0.5379761241342071,1.3443914669624526,1.7193232938186223,-1.627917416019838,2.6639723129754787,2.4826618673576277,0.7253461715234495,-1.6909876651286349,2.4887929161914935,-1.8470798869067828,-1.8762088557988774,-1.8778229353387148,0.8422930733681161,1.038146778838593,0.9110092494835802,-1.0690728625707464,-1.114873602759575,-1.1044660101676886,-1.2881589515360075,-1.2890947949947564,-1.3627176259228295,-0.4716571707626569,1.1682049454876644,0.65714924094429,0.2682133957324787,0.29020631258479995,0.4729985276208935,,,-0.9091555679951312,-0.4685153585420623,-1.0918627868879494,0,-5.376377075617338

26,no_45.txt,"Anti-vaccine mothers discuss their thinking amid backlash
LAKE OSWEGO, Ore. (AP) One is a businesswoman and an MBA graduate. Another is a corporate vice president. The third is a registered nurse.
These three mothers all of them educated, middle-class professionals are among the vaccine skeptics who have been widely ridiculed since more than 100 people fell ill in a measles outbreak traced to Disneyland. Critics question their intelligence, their parenting, even their sanity. Some have been called criminals for foregoing shots for their children that are overwhelmingly shown to be safe and effective.
""Contrary to the common sentiment, we are not anti-science,"" said Michelle Moore, a businesswoman who lives in the affluent Portland suburb of Lake Oswego with her 2-year-old twin girls. ""I'm not opposed to medicine, and I think vaccines have a place. We think it's a medical choice, and it should be researched carefully.""
The backlash, much of it from people who fear unvaccinated children could infect their own kids, has been so severe that dozens of anti-vaccine parents contacted by The Associated Press were afraid to speak out. But a handful of mothers agreed to discuss their thinking.
Moore, an MBA graduate who runs an agriculture-related business, traces her feelings back to the time she took Lariam, a supposedly safe anti-malaria medication. Instead, she said, the drug saddled her with multiple health complications. She questions whether the government knew about the risks at the time. Health officials now acknowledge Lariam can cause severe side effects, some of which can be permanent.
That experience broke Moore's trust in the medical establishment and launched her on years of research into how vaccines can affect people's health. When she got pregnant, Moore and her husband delayed immunization for Sierra and Savannah.
""It was not an easy decision,"" she said. ""The thought of something happening to them because we chose not to vaccinate is terrifying. But I have so many questions, and I do think it's the right decision for our family.""
Nancy Babcock of Spokane, Washington, says people who share her opinions ""are being vilified and ostracized."" Babcock, a vice president at a bank, told her daughter about her doubts. Then her daughter and her husband looked into the issue, and they decided not to immunize their two children.
""In a community with many young people, those who don't vaccinate are feeling a lot of pressure,"" she said.
Nationwide, parents who seek an exemption from vaccine requirements are still in a tiny minority. The median total exemption rate for kindergartners during the 2013-14 school year was just 1.8 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But some individual schools or communities have higher exemption rates, at times approaching 60 percent or more.
The CDC says years of testing are required before a vaccine is approved, and the shots are continually monitored for safety and effectiveness.
Anti-vaccination parents include a mix of views from religious communities to families practicing alternative medicine and libertarians who shun government interference.
But many are Americans with college degrees living in liberal communities such as Santa Monica or Marin County in California and Portland, said Gary Freed, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan.
Most hesitant parents do not avoid all vaccinations. ith otheThey typically under-vaccinate, either delaying the shots until their child is older or refusing certain vaccines while continuing wrs, Freed said.
The parents who spoke to AP recounted spending hundreds of hours reviewing medical studies, books and news stories and networking on social media. They cited cases of children who were supposedly hurt by vaccines and the existence of a government-run vaccine injury-compensation program. And they worried about the oversight of pharmaceutical companies that reap profits from vaccines and are shielded from liability when a vaccine causes harm.
Moore said she read a 1998 study published in The Lancet journal by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who raised the possibility of a link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, bowel disease and autism. She said she knows the study was later discredited and retracted. She believes the research was inconclusive.
Moore concedes that the vast majority of studies show vaccines are safe, but she says some research points to inconsistencies, unknowns or negative effects that deserve further investigation.
And while autism is still a concern, Moore and others also worry about how exposure to chemicals, bad nutrition and stress can affect genes and health. They say large doses of synthetic additives found in vaccines, including aluminum and mercury, can harm the immune and digestive systems and brain.
They're believers in living naturally and eating organic food who also question the safety of genetically modified organisms, pesticides and other common substances such as flame retardants and plastics.
""There are so many environmental toxins, but anything in my children's world that I can influence I do,"" Moore said.
The CDC has phased out a mercury-containing preservative in vaccines as a precautionary measure, and the agency says vaccines containing aluminum pose extremely low risk to infants. Federal officials also say GMOs in foods are safe, as are pesticides if used according to labels.
These parents say they should be able to decide whether their child undergoes a medical procedure a decision, they say, that goes to the core of what it means to have freedom of choice.
""I have the right to decide what to put into my child's body,"" said Heather Dillard, a mom in Springfield, Missouri, who is also a registered nurse. ""Nobody has the right to put toxic chemicals into my son's bloodstream. That's taking my rights away, and it's very scary to me.""
Dillard said she decided against vaccinating because her first child was born a preemie and has autism. Dillard does not believe vaccines caused the autism, but the disease led her to do a lot of research about health. She says she now chooses to build her son's immunity naturally, through diet, while avoiding shots or other medication.
Dillard and others say they are not worried about measles because their children have strong immune systems. They cite statistics: Out of the 1,000-plus measles cases in the past decade, there was not a single death.
""What I'm more nervous about is the hysteria that would result,"" if her children were to get ill, Moore said.
Moore said she does worry about affecting children who are immune-compromised and cannot be vaccinated. Before visiting friends with babies or young children, she said, she always informs them her twins are not vaccinated ""so they have the power to make a choice."" She also keeps the girls home at any sign of sickness.
Researchers say berating parents who oppose vaccines will not persuade anyone and only puts people on the defensive. Educational messages from health officials may also make little difference and could, in fact, be counterproductive, said Brendan Nyhan, assistant professor of government at Dartmouth College.
A study conducted by Nyhan and his colleagues last year showed that when parents were presented with evidence that vaccines do not cause autism or that measles cause great harm, some ended up feeling even more ambivalent.
""We tend to be skeptical toward information that contradicts our existing views,"" Nyhan said.
If Oregon were to take away the right to a vaccine exemption, Moore said, she would likely home-school her twins. She's keeping an open mind about vaccinating as her children get older, but hopes more studies on the long-term effects of vaccines can help dispel her doubts.
""I worry about living in a society that's progressively more intolerant toward any dissent,"" Moore said. ""All scientific advances have come from questioning the status quo.""",33,67,22.313432835820894,0,0.6062325718953754,0.335368948404855,0.2848173425429397,0.2759898503621419,0.16417910447761194,0.37067726962572045,0.36371690337888807,0.28855617090425006,0.33215645952729733,0.21790693064078526,0.19695035515434614,0.17863774930651266,0.1897522580416495,0.10658219555277222,0.9077225362374481,0.18627500738804945,0.14534235965452558,1.2346028712546528,0.2489668232408474,0.15715091589946906,1.318155492585603,0.2681291322547469,0.154209628275994,1.3064549282367606,0.263361897819604,0.03381481481481481,0.023610564519655427,0.03804347826086957,0.04153936545240893,3.1512998400653416,3.569482426681157,0,0,1.20537193938052,6.3996316893959815,9.084678240703685,1.710156877486271,1.4660908635446348,-0.02322681891962883,,-0.20810271052990126,-0.6581812737530139,0.47729086020908135,0.43365243886542815,-0.1320304787737503,-0.31675241972678586,0.01087583222854703,0.46941875929206606,0.5418635991657813,-0.10294558191803456,0.03273248270710124,0.7920429285551923,0.4343997041236425,0.2657936563903977,0.32493719695861956,0.37342960823169097,0.843640415903836,0.905541295931251,0.9351038457570369,-0.03196207039065685,-0.33929329418298915,0.0714038133876008,-0.5000236969955933,-0.6572700338324116,-0.44451128750583263,0.13209006967497217,-0.2780817637555601,0.022796352037327248,0.2420032655520563,0.002950784772542994,0.10317342715648471,,,1.1871393221868796,-0.5388104709645092,-0.786910977742974,0,0.8379546449335756
27,no_48.txt,"Peak flu season arrives later in valley
PALM DESERT, Calif. -Flu season is in full force across the United States. It is especially bad in some states, but that is not yet the case in California.
According to Dr. Russell Grant, Medical Director of Eisenhower Urgent Care, the flu peaks from late November through April. 
""It generally does start on the east coast where it's colder and then it gradually moves across the country,"" said Grant.
That explains why the Coachella Valley doesn't experience peak flu season until January and February. 
""As we get more visitors though from other parts of the country we do see a peak in our flu volumes,"" explained Grant. 
He also said he sees an increase in respiratory infections in December, which often have similar but less severe symptoms than the flu. 
According to Grant, the best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu shot even though it does not cover all strains of the flu. 
""If you get the vaccine and you do end up getting the influenza the severity of your illness is usually less,"" added Grant.
Grant does not suspect this flu season will be worse than usual. However, it is still too early to tell. Regardless, he recommends individuals take measure to prevent the flu. 
""Stay away from large crowds, stay away from other sick people,"" concluded Grant. ""If you do get respiratory symptoms yourself make sure you throw your kleenex away, and wash your hands frequently and thoroughly.""",11,15,19.4,0,0.6970011235347816,0.5372582347390042,0.07413803345777771,0.0877376300367442,0.06666666666666667,0.41947368171531707,0.41851362702877715,0.12753543899291092,0.314422607051765,0.27958484494592994,0.23318120372432255,0.0752549461580606,0.18759576702950062,0.033317220360744464,0.29579562725161157,0.05830087609814992,0.13178827814749983,1.126807872006013,0.22403480412668306,0.1707156602978791,1.4187626538901599,0.28686235652549164,0.16837485537915858,1.4082201980239095,0.2825945807465013,0,0.028138528138528136,0.125,0.08901515151515152,3.222734961865166,3.641945947984136,0,0,1.1904730563554093,6.123400276971705,8.767305920144386,-0.5121734198857352,-0.7804516830146815,-0.6016357174871356,,0.5637733178393396,0.9438683412915901,-1.4300439739479132,-1.300113566703649,-0.5182695792736317,0.9606541018573002,1.775322528264758,-1.052686407234329,0.2586949135992541,1.901700986039198,1.8730117951200986,-0.9696293403304039,0.3793241830983639,-1.490276414148802,-1.4706456369066645,-1.484209737760877,0.27833523869026383,0.35528354405751233,0.3051233029770223,1.4050925906727818,1.6792925796800173,1.6761484930665322,1.4402847393030394,1.6036284928561775,1.5909528309297185,-0.9902743599907043,-0.12598407549868113,2.677319210232618,2.848285148959882,1.0156891875169478,1.293775131199987,,,0.8808873769406266,-1.4352264640217371,-1.8983166957254818,0,-7.37938332494684
28,no_6.txt,"Readers React: Vaccine skeptics are in denial
To the editor: My child is a student at Waldorf School of Orange County, and its unbelievable that 41% of kindergartners started the school year unvaccinated. Just recently a Waldorf parent told me that no one is talking about the measles epidemic not one conversation. (Once easily recognized, signs of measles now elude young doctors, Jan. 26)
Maybe as a society we value a dogs life more than a human life.
All dogs in California that are 4 months or older are legally required to be vaccinated for rabies. A law enacted in 2011 allows an exemption for the rabies shot if the dog has existing medical conditions that would further deteriorate its health but requires that the animal be confined to the owners home or be kept on a short leash when away from home.
In contrast, a parent of a human child may sign a paper claiming a belief exemption from all vaccinations. Wow.
Gina Piazza, Costa Mesa
To the editor: I do not dispute the value of vaccines, and all my children were inoculated on schedule. However, I sympathize with the so-called deniers.
For generations, many members of the medical establishment have over-promised their ability to prevent and cure disease, told us to take medications that were later determined to have terrible side effects, and more recently failed to protect us from extortionary medical billing practices by their hospitals and insurance companies.
It is both rational and reasonable for some people to no longer trust their doctors.
Rather than ridiculing them, members of the medical community should ask first: What part do we have in this? Once they answer that question, they can begin to rebuild the publics faith in them.
David Fleck, Granada Hills
To the editor: Well-meaning but misguided parents must realize that measles shots are not lethal injections.
Quite the opposite: Failure to protect their (and other peoples) children is a rash decision that could sicken, disable or even kill innocents.

29,no_64.txt,"Rand Paul Now Says He Shares Obama's Position On Vaccinations
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Wednesday continued to walk back his comments that parents should be allowed to choose whether to vaccinate their children, saying he holds the same position as President Barack Obama on the matter.
""I got annoyed that people were trying to depict me as someone who doesn't think vaccines were a good idea,"" Paul told Fox News host Greta Van Susteren on Wednesday, noting that he had been vaccinated before a recent trip to Guatemala and had vaccinated his children.
""I'm not sure I'm different from the president or anyone else on the position,"" Paul said. ""We have rules to encourage people to have vaccines in the country, but I don't think anybody's recommending that we hold them down.""
Pressed by Van Susteren on whether vaccinations should be required when an illness could spread to other children, Paul said certain school vaccine requirements were already ""somewhat of a mandate,"" but really more of an encouragement.
""Interestingly, 48 out of 50 states do have a religious as well as philosophic exemption if you have a problem,"" Paul said.
Paul has faced heavy criticism since Monday, when he said vaccinations for children should be voluntary, and suggested a relationship between vaccinations and mental disorders.
""I've heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children, who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines,"" Paul said. ""I'm not arguing that vaccines are a bad idea, I think they're a good thing. But I think parents should have some input.""
Paul softened those comments on Tuesday, saying he believes children should be vaccinated. He said he didn't mean to suggest that vaccinations cause mental disabilities.
During an interview with NBC's Savannah Guthrie on Wednesday, President Barack Obama said parents should get their kids vaccinated.
""The science is, you know, pretty indisputable,"" Obama said. ""Weve looked at this again and again. There is every reason to get vaccinated, but there arent reasons to not.""
The White House has stopped short of saying that there should be a law requiring parents to get their children vaccinated. ""The president believes it shouldnt require a law for people to exercise common sense and do the right thing,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday. ""And again, this is the right thing for them to do both by their own children, but by also other children in the community. They have a responsibility to do this. ""
Several Republicans also have voiced support for vaccinations.
""Unless they are immune-suppressed for medical exceptions, but I believe all children should be vaccinated,"" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Tuesday. ""Absolutely, all children in America should be vaccinated.""
House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said all children should be vaccinated, and didn't know if another law was required.
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) helped fuel the controversy this week, saying parents should ""have some measure of choice"" in vaccinating their children.",16,26,23.346153846153847,0,0.6732713878154755,0.48400674869234744,0.1583104869350791,0.1627428554929793,0.11538461538461539,0.3641201405642697,0.36462850073233133,0.15485476680203444,0.3265286591118811,0.238882998828418,0.23898892054991439,0.14530907025974657,0.1784353298520381,0.08104820768366514,0.6035169106511198,0.1266471094887543,0.13059469444135183,1.0938920793618039,0.22218715220289,0.15593667439184036,1.2753668620017977,0.2595232036710537,0.16327763821738298,1.293839660175351,0.2671439661071118,0.050694444444444445,0.015922619047619047,0.03896103896103896,0.07925407925407925,3.150459515505291,3.5849311895223583,0,0,1.1339248742975452,5.898409544216998,8.824365671421173,-0.007098352301188288,-0.30522152893482607,0.1818010831380136,,0.36198080456850035,0.5213024673382811,-0.6680087589528823,-0.6093301596804254,-0.3253016142279688,-0.4884068317476132,0.04022913715741884,-0.7944408415192793,0.452000618267361,0.5788155245541956,2.1680040889342234,0.22411279078396312,0.145371967426783,-0.34622418379757125,-0.5676962062256549,-0.49211351474241793,0.22855399396530948,0.18725932968957876,0.2584369613498253,-0.16059932052557563,-1.1978059898841016,-0.6658060715090288,0.7420838994146437,-0.9375409065326799,-0.04424137602463836,0.6923502983936274,-0.5363256084869781,0.05080673933971252,2.312430813382448,-0.008962528053005984,0.3570021541264814,,,-0.28148101847346707,-2.1653580930097074,-1.6984992266912469,0,-2.3672511020729328
30,no_70.txt,"Why I chose not to vaccinate my child
TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (WTHI) The measles outbreak is sparking a national debate. Should parents be required to vaccinate their children?
You may be surprised that a large percentage of children in the Wabash Valley have not been immunized.
Only 28 percent of children between the ages of 19 -35 months have received their vaccinations, thats according to the Vigo County Health Department. Those parents who have decided against vaccines are receiving backlash.
When it comes to her anti-vaccination stance, Natalie Garland knows full well that shes in the minority.
I think theres a common misconception that if you dont immunize your children than youre an idiot who cant face the facts.
Garland argues its just the opposite. During her pregnancy it was facts and hours of discussion that lead to the controversial decision not to vaccinate her now two-year old daughter Luci.
It wasnt a knee jerk reaction because of Jenny McCarthy on the View, said Garland.
Instead, what she found was research that left too many unanswered questions.
It was just something that we didnt have a level of comfort with. It didnt feel like it solved enough problems to take on the unknowns of what could be, said Garland.
Once eliminated, measles is now back in full force and has sickened more than 150 people. Health officials believe the vaccine is the only way to eliminate the disease once again.
It has been proven over, and over, and over again that this is a safe vaccine. This vaccine has saved millions of lives, said John Bolinger, Chief Medical Officer at Union Hospital.
Despite the measles being highly contagious, Garland doesnt fear her daughter will contract the disease.
I can give her the best health foundation possible with the foods I give her and the nutrients I give her, said Garland.
As for those claiming its part of parents civic duty to have their children immunized, Garland doesnt believe her daughter is a danger to those with weaker immune systems.
When youre making a decision for your family you still have to do whats best for your inner circle.

31,no_71.txt,"Clintons' medical adviser an anti-vaccination activist?
Hillary Clinton jumped into the vaccination fray this week with a tweet hashtagged #GrandmothersKnowBest, but does that knowledge extend to the choice of medical adviser? The Daily Callers Chuck Ross wonders about that too, considering that the Clintons personal physician co-wrote a book with anti-vaccination activist Robert F. Kennedy claiming a link between thimerasol and autism the same claim that a debunked study made in 1998. Dr. Mark Hyman even appeared on TV to promote the core anti-vaccine argument on Dr. Oz:
Dr. Mark Hyman most recently expressed those skeptical views in a book he co-wrote with Robert Kennedy Jr. titled: Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak.
In the book and in a recent TV appearance on Dr. Oz, Hyman and Kennedy expressed concern that the mercury in thimerosal, a preservative used in some vaccines, is associated with autism, developmental delays and certain illnesses.
That belief is considered controversial in the medical community.
While Hyman has claimed that he is not a so-called anti-vaxxer, he has questioned whether people should get the flu vaccine and has supported the theory that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) can cause autism and other issues.
Just to make this clear: the MMR vaccine used in the US has no thimerasol or mercury in it. The FDA did two reviews of the hypothesized thimerasol/mercury link to autism and found no evidence to support it. Only the flu vaccines have trace elements of either.
Ross isnt the first to report that Hyman is the personal medical adviser to the Clintons. In April of last year, the New York Times did an extensive profile of Hyman, noting that he had spent the last decade helping Bill Clinton remain healthy after a quadruple bypass. Not only had Hyman become their personal physician, the Times Amy Chozick reported, he had become one of their inner circle:
Dr. Hyman was charged with helping the former president after a 2004 quadruple bypass surgery. In the time since, the doctor has become part of the Clintons circle of friends and advisers, but one with an important difference.
The Clintons, after all, have a small army of aides who offer political and policy advice, but not many who can tell a former and potential president to lay off the ranch dressing. 
Dr. Hyman, who made a name for himself advising the moneyed urbanites who retreat to Canyon Ranch in Lenox, Mass., met Mrs. Clinton at a fund-raiser in New York when she was in the Senate. The two quickly dived into a wonky conversation about childhood obesity and his philosophy of healthful eating. She then called me and weve just become friends, he said.
Chozick included testimonials from both Clintons in the article:
The Clintons have, in turn, referred several friends to Dr. Hyman. In his other life, this guy is a real doctor, Mr. Clinton said during a 2012 panel discussion with Dr. Hyman, Jillian Michaels (of Biggest Loser fame) and Billie Jean King, among others, at a health conference hosted by the Clinton Foundation.
He did amazing blood work on me and a lot of other people I know, Mr. Clinton said, adding that it all started with a very sophisticated biomedical analysis and he basically gave them their whole lives back.
In other words, Ross is correct: Hyman is a close adviser to the Clintons, especially on medical issues. How does one resolve that against Clintons tweet:
The science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork. Let's protect all our kids. #GrandmothersKnowBest
Hes not just a political aide with an opinion, or a doctor who may have had a passing curiosity about test results. Hes an activist for vaccination skepticism, and hes the same doctor Hillary and Bill have been referred to their friends and colleagues for years. Will the media go after Hyman and the Clintons the way they went after Republican candidates who said much less this week?
In my column for The Fiscal Times, I conclude that this all seems very familiar:
Meanwhile, the media has preened over the last few days about settled science while not taking a very close look at their track records. Jon Stewart spent Tuesday night railing at Paul, Christie, and the mindful stupidity of science-denying affluent California liberals, without noting that Stewart himself offered his platform to Robert F. Kennedy Jr in 2005 to promote the same kind of science denial from an affluent Massachusetts liberal.
The Washington Post, where Ruth Marcus cast this issue as a Republican episode of science denial, had just one week earlier offered an explainer that the problem wasnt entirely limited to the left.
The policy positions staked out by Christie and Paul are also virtually indistinguishable from the White House, too. Both urged parents to vaccinate, but didnt endorse a governmental mandate requiring it. Thats precisely what the White House says, too, according to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. The President believes it shouldnt require a law for people to exercise common sense and do the right thing, Earnest replied on a question specifically asking about the measles vaccine and the state-based regulations that allow parents to opt out for personal and/or religious beliefs.
In other words, most of the news along these lines is actually not news at all. Its reminiscent of the way the media blew up the non-issue of contraception into a war on women in the 2012 cycle. Few are willing to force parents to vaccinate, while every potential candidate believes that vaccinations especially the core vaccinations are safe and necessary. Perhaps at some point we can get back to issues that truly matter in the next presidential race, such as national security policy, federal spending, and the economy, rather than chase media-created rabbits down non-existent holes.

32,no_72.txt,"Christie: Parents Should Have Some Measure of Choice on Vaccinations (UPDATED)
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie expressed the need for some measure of choice Monday morning in whether parents should vaccinate their children.
Mary Pat and I have had our children vaccinated and we think that its an important part of being sure we protect their health and the public health, Christie said. I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so thats the balance that the government has to decide.
Not every vaccine is created equal, Christie added, and not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others.
The remark comes in the wake of the most severe measles outbreak in years, a disease long thought eradicated due to vaccines, but one thats reemerged, along with whooping cough, since vaccines have become a matter of controversy. The recent measles outbreak began at Disneyland and has since spread to over 100 cases in fourteen states.
Apparently for ironic lulz, Christie made the remarks while standing in front of MedImmune, an English biotech lab that produces vaccines, on the same morning that President Barack Obama told Savannah Guthrie that parents should vaccinate their children, echoing advice from CDC Director Tom Frieden.
UPDATE 10:32 a.m.: Christies office hurried to clarify his remarks:

33,no_75.txt,"Opinion: The current flu outbreak could use some of last years Ebola panic
People lost their minds last fall when four people in the United States were diagnosed with Ebola. Four! Only one of the four succumbed to the devastating disease. The others were cured. Folks were calling for travel bans. They were demanding quarantines. All to protect us from a disease that could only be transmitted if one came into direct contact with an infected persons bodily fluids, such as vomit, blood or diarrhea. Late last month, a lab technician at the Centers for Disease Control, was placed under observation for possible exposure. A positive diagnosis would make that individual the fifth case in the United States. Still, no one else has died of Ebola in this country.
Im hammering at this point because we are in the middle of a far more serious health crisis, but awareness of it is scarce. News of the H3N2 strain of the influenza virus was a mere digest nugget on page A3 of The Post today. The New York Times had a little something online Monday afternoon.
Widespread influenza activity was reported by 43 states, an increase from 36 states during the previous week, the CDC announced yesterday. Hospitalizations are up, 12.6 per 100,000 people in the final week of December compared to 8.9 per 100,000 during the same period in the 2013-2014 season. So far, the 2014-2015 flu season has claimed the lives of 21 children. Six of them died in the last week of December alone.
According to the CDC (and countless anecdotes from people everywhere), the flu is oh so easily spread. Infinitely easier than it is to contract Ebola.
People with flu can spread it to others up to about 6 feet away. Most experts think that flu viruses are spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Less often, a person might also get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth or nose.
This year like every year, the CDC is urging Americans to get their flu shots to guard against the nasty respiratory virus. But adding to the urgency of the data is an acknowledgment made by CDC chief Tom Frieden during a press call last month. Unfortunately, about half of the H3N2 viruses that weve analyzed this season are different from the H3N2 virus thats included in this years flu vaccine, he said. They are different enough that were concerned that protection from vaccinations against these drifted H3N2 viruses may be lower than we usually see.
In 2009, we were in the grips of nationwide Swine Flu hysteria. People were as concerned about the vaccine as they were about the actual H1N1 virus. Americans ought to be just as worried and aware six years later about the current flu outbreak as they were about Ebola five months ago.",8,31,18.322580645161292,0,0.48765424229204657,0.2802089085316746,0.3736498101821376,0.3438606831969486,0.03225806451612903,0.4355809672058306,0.390676012056447,0.39290586296128965,0.2480528010281198,0.208336362530562,0.1774148501869705,0.19235565551068812,0.1323484874732623,0.12443573484687082,1.087954357834107,0.2176833346161878,0.09281300597098867,0.8105895052802384,0.1612529907017927,0.15280399502353822,1.3141962954050896,0.2645402208655543,0.15042780076757123,1.307687479122938,0.25919155347592027,0.015873015873015872,0.00845959595959596,0.023255813953488372,0.0200845665961945,3.206118065809368,3.6021857640059634,0,0,1.173545817935796,6.78931312783826,9.31584258392855,-0.8152184604364633,-0.08920782253489182,-0.8155376597819471,,-1.2164670443410888,-1.0958920718307923,1.281514401040406,1.0587294899368618,-0.6545593474552884,1.382315257862363,0.8789552914700166,1.4558209667600681,-0.8010776743903638,-0.4140067896729093,-0.959537559755946,1.0257999385326435,-1.031659071479181,0.6937207242067481,0.8537931113219501,0.8293447518838867,-1.347221102642721,-1.2589064349632988,-1.2812432370540734,-0.4924766752041884,-0.41873077553910404,-0.23603319662247446,-1.0180465825997074,-0.6298866987471127,-0.8858738527471833,-0.46342515188602124,-0.7870141419294409,-0.4286268665801859,-0.9358024794062689,0.780110828495238,0.6405010155305729,,,0.5329418507614802,0.7257693628477041,0.022603136156517135,0,2.660974356018693

The Spokane Regional Health District recently urged people to make sure they are up to date on the measles vaccine.
Writing on his personal Facebook page last weekend, Fagan questioned the use of vaccines and linked recent outbreaks of contagious disease to illegal immigration.
Other City Council members and others on the 12-member health board have distanced themselves from Fagan's opinions.",7,8,19.0,0,0.8162677671228137,0.6819007072065558,0.06249095286641802,0.06249095286641802,0.0,0.37791370041668415,0.42649840289617286,0.05310538411140442,0.24876224455379306,0.2090695146471262,0.20229588757159517,0.019520756655505726,0.1427211988539923,0.021022777952566914,0.18013963621390866,0.03598882854158828,0.09713458707119288,0.861652865811564,0.16857155219708617,0.1445331858153268,1.2546745032532853,0.2497921746519381,0.15124465578333068,1.2874294322860214,0.2598494322932328,0,0.0,0,0.022058823529411766,3.2671466942921827,3.619118616937497,0,0,1.0901168014375562,6.424722776474798,9.410075801219591,-0.9162334739533726,-1.0828708719745894,-0.6810484146265267,,1.5779909241241743,2.0916480057964764,-1.5354880378410327,-1.532630508898689,-0.7823310051255915,-0.12731505149577804,2.032431173807739,-1.7562627090882037,-0.7897494990305116,-0.3901779865945537,0.3042489696118084,-1.919355726975935,-0.7667460806435386,-1.7849588635781681,-1.810016089637945,-1.8080856415311066,-1.166979293677102,-0.9982448999669066,-1.0963183289645173,-1.36868964128262,-1.6129782552083274,-1.4993954643725902,-0.9061563413231073,-1.0799556500010228,-0.8162481675524373,-0.9902743599907043,-1.0711783043089333,-1.1385573984231125,-0.8274215445137671,1.6453159849245933,0.9187138761823378,,,-1.1819718477691457,-0.45738580045637595,0.35259831764110705,0,-6.216766321927017
35,no_79.txt,"Kristen Bell: You Must Be Vaccinated To Touch My Children
Kristen Bell takes vaccination seriously. In fact, she wont let people touch her children if theyre anti-vaxxers. When [daughter] Lincoln was born [in March 2013], the whooping cough epidemic was growing, and before she was 2 months old, we simply said [to friends], You have to get a whooping cough vaccination if you are going to hold our baby,' Bell tells The Hollywood Reporter. And the actress has the same policy with her new infant daughter Delta: Its a very simple logic: I believe in trusting doctors, not know-it-alls.
The vaccination debate has intensified in recent weeks amid a measles outbreak and the continuing belief in certain corners than vaccination causes autism. The scientific community is virtually unanimous in its support of vaccination, but some parents have argued its their right not to vaccinate their children against their will.
Bell, of course, has also been very outspoken about another threat to her children: paparazzi attention. Along with her husband Dax Shepard, Bell launched the No Kids Policy last year to combat unwanted tabloid photographs of celebrity children. Their advocacy has forced a number of high-profile news outlets to stop buying invasive pictures from paparazzi cameramen.

36,no_8.txt,"US Government Caught Freezing Vaccine Petition Regarding People To Have Own Free Choice
At the moment, there seem to be many dirty tactics being used against people who are questioning the necessity for vaccination. One of the most intense and a direct hit to our human rights has happened in the last few days.
A WhiteHouse.gov petition was started last week calling for the prohibition of mandatory vaccine laws to be abolished, to allow us to have our choice in relation to the vaccines we receive or choose to have given to our children.
It has been a long-standing rule that petitions to the government must be acknowledged and responded to once they hit 100,000 signatures.
This particular petition regarding vaccine choice has remained stuck at 56,791 signatures. This last count of signatures in a petition which is steadily gaining momentum was from midday Friday (27 February) and now as I check today being Sunday 1 March it is STILL stuck at 56,791.
Natural News wrote:
The petition reads:
No human being should be FORCED to be vaccinated against their will and/or personal/religious beliefs. I petition against making vaccinations of any kind mandatory. This includes forcing children to be vaccinated to attend public schools, activities, and daycare centers. This also includes adults working in the public or private sector.
The petition still allows people to sign it, and it still sends a confirmation email that claims your signature counts. But the numbers on the petition website never change, no matter how many people sign it.
You can see for yourself here:
This is truly outrageous and speaks volumes about what the government really thinks in relation to us having any personal choice in the future, and about what we or our children are given in terms of vaccinations.
Have a think about this for a moment and what it could mean.
Mike Adams from Natural News also wrote:
Before the petition was frozen by the White House to prevent it from reaching 100,000 signatures, it was throttled to allow a maximum of 100 signatures per hour.
Dr. Rima Laibow of the Natural Solutions Foundation has been monitoring the petitions numbers for several days. Counsel Ralph Fucetola, JD, and I were tracking the number of signatures for the petition on our Skype chat and I noted something rather strange: there were many hours when the number increasing on the petition was exactly, EXACTLY, 100, she told Natural News.
We realized that although it is really important in this debate to get to the 100,000 signature threshold on this petition, the system was gamed, making it harder than it should be. We knew that if we did not reach that number, the White House juggernaught would claim that only a tiny fraction of Americans were against Mandatory Adult Vaccines and would use that against us.
USA Today Survey Shows: People Want The Choice
Those that say they want forced vaccines say so because they would personally take them, which means that they had a choice to make that decision. But hardly any people want them to be mandatory. USA Today ran an opinion poll (also seen on Natural News) with the results being quite staggering. 92% of people surveyed said that vaccines should be a personal choice.
No Choice = Forced Vaccinations
So, where could all this be headed? Well, its pretty obvious it means that they could bring in FORCED vaccinations for ALL of us. That doesnt just mean our children, that means for every single one of us adults too. How do you really feel about that?
Many adults are very much behind in their vaccines. Theyve not had any in years, nor as many in comparison to children today.
You might be dismayed to learn that there is a National Adult Immunization Plan in the pipeline to make adults have more vaccines and they may be keeping an eye on how many you have.
Journalist Alicia Bayer wrote in her article U.S. Unveils comprehensive new adult vaccination plan:
Think youre up to date on your vaccinations? You might be surprised at how many vaccinations are now recommended for American adults and the federal government plans to start tracking which of those vaccines youre behind on.
You can read her article in full here.
And if you havent had many or any vaccinations, imagine if they began to give you everything youve missed all at once. Imagine if your child hasnt had any either, and all of a sudden they give say, 20 vaccines in one single day.
You might think vaccines are a good idea, but would you really want to be given any number of them that you have absolutely no say in? And what would happen if you spoke up and said, No I dont want to have this amount, I want to do it like this, but were told you had to do it their way?
Or what if they put you in jail, fined you, or worse, forced them upon you? If you think this couldnt happen think again.
With people like Dr. Paul Offit saying a child can safely have 10,000 vaccines at once, then giving 20 at one time might not be seen as a big deal by some administering doctors.
Its not unheard of for a child to receive 9 vaccines in one day, and sometimes even more are given. A mother recently told me her 6 month old was given 11 vaccines in one day to catch up on all the ones he had missed. Sadly, her baby boy died a few days later.
This mothers baby received 11 vaccines in one day
Giving one vaccine can have a risk of adverse reactions and injury but giving multiple vaccines at once can make that risk much higher.
With all of this coverage about the petition freezing, chances are they will suddenly let it go again to gain a few more numbers, but Id be willing to bet those signatures never quite make the 100k mark.
I am certain we could get 100k signatures alone just from Collective Evolution readers. We have millions of people visiting us each month from the USA and many are pro-vaccine choice.
What Can We Do?
Visit the petition yourself, sign it, and see that its true you wont see the signature number rise.
Id also be sending as many emails/tweets as you can to the White House or even phone calls to your local congressmen. Contact your news stations and papers. Tell them what is happening. Chances are they probably wont take the story up, but its always worth a try.
At the very least, show your friends on Facebook what is happening. Most reasonable people will agree, we should be able to have our choice.
Our freedom is very much at stake here. And without our freedom what do we have left?",39,66,19.363636363636363,0,0.6517829660039681,0.3126237311573332,0.18393178710825422,0.17525946115278918,0.07575757575757576,0.3615940978994504,0.33990750906452527,0.19993619482826303,0.2617007853387965,0.2501552924402945,0.2124348918110052,0.12957330013004134,0.16523829066855966,0.08871026157195575,0.7297923727356261,0.14808765868808646,0.11868457097422248,0.9938498504370322,0.19986122158086067,0.16277427654447713,1.373293880713186,0.275884487521817,0.16205788576198385,1.3728419709532735,0.2750614317507213,0.026037533068783068,0.06036741036741037,0.050955414012738856,0.044747238571313394,3.096390218100525,3.5269231744362544,0,0,1.1035828004425565,5.650047478545955,8.698883455032288,2.3162469585877274,1.422888122264648,-0.6088550535907165,,0.1792479374662292,-0.8386711214172806,-0.4360524338211358,-0.49405467787956525,-0.48226120302109177,-0.5545343037411491,-0.7557832731773986,-0.36829276916488823,-0.5831508712200396,0.9451859661722194,0.8192410409185749,-0.044029192435951825,-0.19167270603875808,-0.16257430912253357,-0.1971649405992986,-0.18088805541779265,-0.2681860067297658,-0.32342309866321334,-0.3056931168011439,0.5637790942343656,0.7670054020398771,0.7357510140607051,0.5750060289244372,0.8176375390842842,0.7936925351082308,-0.12604957825856922,0.9566082098467105,0.4169591809015165,0.4181061231861039,-0.7755049866024252,-0.5960903863385288,,,-0.9051733533441028,-2.9713335097168283,-2.1379252376110243,0,3.2168050517991964
37,no_9.txt,"Danish Ebola vaccine enters human trials
Bavarian Nordic's promising Ebola vaccine began Phase 1 human trials this week at Oxford and plans to expand to the United States and Africa shortly.
The Danish biomedical company Bavarian Nordic has advanced its Ebola vaccine into the human trial phase, the company has announced.
According to Reuters, Bavarians vaccine is just the third to enter human testing as researchers continue their efforts to contain an outbreak of Ebola that has killed more than 8,000 people in western Africa.
The company began its Phase 1 trials on Tuesday, having enrolled 72 healthy adult volunteers into four groups that will receive different regimens of Bavarians MVA-BN Filovirus and Johnson & Johnsons AdVac. The initial trials are being held at the University of Oxford and Bavarian said that additional clinic studies will soon get underway in the United States and Africa and will ultimately involve some 300 human subjects.
If these initial studies produce positive results, the company will move to Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials in the coming months. 
 
This first-in-human trial of this Ebola vaccine regimen is a testament of the accelerated efforts by Bavarian Nordic, Johnson & Johnson, the public health authorities and other key stakeholders to make the vaccines broadly available to protect families and frontline health care professionals, Bavarian Nordics president and CEO, Paul Chaplin, said in a statement.
 
Bavarian Nordic is working closely with Crucell Holland BV, a subsidiary of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson.
 
In October, Bavarian Nordic and Crucell Holland BV signed a global licence and supply agreement for the MVA-BN Filovirus Ebola vaccine. 
 
According to the company, when combined with Janssens AdVac, MVA-BN Filovirus has demonstrated complete protection against Ebola in pre-clinical studies.",14,15,22.0,0,0.9220325648784637,0.7849106612659636,0.03922538246427264,0.03922538246427264,0.0,0.41354995877482,0.373662827212754,0.03117337729781866,0.1822852971928739,0.22462657975653808,0.20898717056599356,0.01658720676121967,0.10868871477590937,0.011332063880697255,0.09549361826621185,0.019126999289965276,0.07834868221999437,0.6734715862330878,0.1338430565736922,0.1589857070388952,1.3592579975890104,0.27016004322065346,0.15936571895811547,1.3584424457111095,0.2703073982728874,0.017857142857142856,0.012755102040816327,0,0.043010752688172046,3.191186531949164,3.556307257087247,0,0,1.1010626102292769,6.173097422550221,8.99720619355214,-0.20912837933500703,-0.7804516830146815,-0.08545318608109187,,2.4773917690029768,2.9090616498939568,-1.746117325820168,-1.7469018465418271,-0.7823310051255915,0.8055811775948722,0.33113316293718864,-1.9635827261257124,-1.8512328868414074,0.11545547281165065,0.6441203817955244,-1.969344248671706,-1.6359158484865193,-2.0172331924667026,-2.0583936892336756,-2.0528475879299997,-1.9504900956092965,-1.958847975873347,-1.973835565838832,0.1624164657282607,0.4853889143637688,0.24537779247083985,0.2062414532896446,0.497726183539143,0.2905560461039214,-0.3975690008729359,-0.6427248764141761,-1.1385573984231125,0.3227781239394225,0.5684259125727678,-0.1132993454539526,,,-0.9569767773931838,-1.2739511198641025,-1.0932292262800205,0,-5.104405327768778
38,yes_0.txt,"Militant Australian vaccine and fluoride fanatics seek to eliminate all forms of free speech
(NaturalNews) Perhaps the only country in the world more committed than the U.S. and England to poisoning its own citizens with deadly chemicals in the name of ""public health"" is Australia, where bitter establishment fogies are angrily resisting all forms of free speech that question or object to the longstanding status quo.
Fluoride truth-teller Professor Paul Connett, who recently held a forum on water fluoridation in Australia, was reportedly snubbed by every single government official he invited to the event to present their opinion on the controversial practice, which by definition amounts to nothing less than forced mass medication with a dangerous pharmaceutical drug.
Prof. Connett organized the open forum with the intent to generate honest dialogue about artificial water fluoridation, an outdated practice that most of Europe and the rest of the developed world outside of North America has rejected based on credible science showing that it can damage health.
Pro-fluoride lobby refuses to attend Prof. Connett's forum after lying about not getting invitations
The pro-fluoride news rag The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) initially reported that many of Prof. Connett's invitees hadn't actually received invitations, hence why they weren't planning to show up to the event. These folks included representatives from many of the top dental and health associations in Australia.
""No one's been invited and no one's attending,"" was the official statement given by a spokesperson from NSW Health, which almost violently insists that fluoride is absolutely safe with no possible side effects.
But a followup article published by SMH just one day later revealed that leading health and dental experts had explicitly ""refused to attend the forum,"" their ridiculous excuse being that they didn't want to lend any credibility to the anti-fluoridation position by presenting science in favor of fluoridation.
This is completely illogical, of course, as the first thing any legitimate agency authority that claims to have a corner on the truth would want to do is substantiate its dogmatic assertions when challenged. Instead, the pro-fluoride elite in Australia decided to just give empty statements to the corrupt state media about how anti-fluoride advocates are ""confusing"" and ""scaring"" the public with a bunch of nonsense.
Science shows that fluoride is dangerous, but pro-druggers refuse to acknowledge this
It's an absurd strawman argument that simply doesn't stand up to scrutiny, and the establishment in Australia more than likely knows this. There's plenty of scientific evidence to suggest that artificial water fluoridation doesn't prevent tooth decay [studies have suggested that topical application of fluoride could be beneficial], but can trigger a host of ailments ranging from tooth mottling (a form of tooth decay!) to thyroid dysfunction and cancer.
But why address any of this when you can just personally attack the opposition -- in this case, Australian health authorities compared Prof. Connett's position to those crazy ""anti-vaxxers"" and people who believe the earth is flat.
""The two go together,"" declared Prof. Wendell Evans from Sydney University, who was invited to speak at the panel but turned down the invitation, adding that opposing vaccines and fluoride lacks ""any scientific proof,"" as paraphrased by SMH.
But you see, you can't just decree that something lacks scientific proof without actually backing this up. It's the same thing pro-vaccine fanatics did to Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, who incurred the wrath of the establishment recently for planning to speak about vaccines while visiting the country.
As we reported back in January, Dr. Tenpenny was verbally attacked and threatened with the removal of her travel visa for simply responding ""yes"" to an invitation to speak at a national tour on vaccine exemptions. If Dr. Tenpenny's and Prof. Connett's ideas are so ludicrous, as the establishment claims, then why bother with trying to censor them? What are you trying to hide?",15,22,33.77272727272727,0,0.7291346057539895,0.5057867727356053,0.15869597643613814,0.15114998287624784,0.13636363636363635,0.39034979567788114,0.38779998180573727,0.152673519437667,0.3871689766126865,0.2213845181161131,0.1907999634697971,0.0838760950427968,0.20327999068166974,0.05389311697523355,0.46278459251783544,0.09193005151971201,0.1497157171295681,1.2888299147495283,0.25934708402288825,0.14550029915147286,1.2670739517886997,0.25181458036704896,0.14954648981329965,1.284897221174644,0.26065077436091566,0.01171875,0.006767676767676767,0,0.017763845350052248,3.1014510828131447,3.532012387719965,0,0,1.160845185516238,6.199549049877997,9.17429364825887,-0.10811336581809766,-0.4780324940547735,2.2518068774532662,,0.8370294642144658,0.6941332290281921,-0.6645188217741226,-0.7160982414328718,-0.24220536133749204,0.19824062994500682,0.7863475270717667,-0.8150598502852056,1.4202865010292505,0.010082458600603918,-0.27966535027359846,-0.8227225197215146,0.7798900953390299,-0.9970978370113751,-0.9806483593332774,-0.9960573369067951,1.0260416816159914,1.1823523841286117,1.1973915606719134,-1.2662332523772581,-1.3641952527587276,-1.3261500708102678,-1.1387657964267492,-1.1362132748562586,-0.7314392497555215,-0.6013114680696687,-0.8438469744053394,-1.1385573984231125,-1.0632032923652526,-0.7037569176353691,-0.512472782627383,,,0.2718757441418285,-1.1881112743124735,-0.47308689818668687,0,-2.3672487035574874
39,yes_100.txt,"A New Polio Case in Pakistan and an Unsolved Epidemic
Pakistan records its first polio case in 2015, and may become the planet's last refuge for the crippling disease.
TIME TO CHECK in on another globe-spanning epidemic. While we were all watching Ebola, polio continues---and as long as it does, it holds the possibility of surging back over the rest of the world.
A quick refresher: Polio has been the target of a very expensive and aggressive multi-national eradication campaign since 1988. By last summer, polio was endemic---that is, transmission from one person to another has never been interrupted---in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. Very high rates of vaccination have kept the paralyzing disease from leaking over those countries' borders to most of the rest of the world---but every once in a while, something slips through, or a country runs out of money and lets its vaccination campaigns lapse.
As a result, last year, there was still polio in seven other countries -- Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Iraq, Israel, Somalia and Syria---and the World Health Organization declared an international emergency.
So, updates: Despite its ongoing civil strife, Syria has not had a polio case in a year. There has been no detection of polio virus in sewage in Israel or the West Bank or Gaza since March. It has been almost 6 months since the last polio case in Nigeria---extremely good news because that country has periodically re-infected other areas of Africa.
But: Pakistan remains a problem.
In 2014, Pakistan recorded its highest number of cases of any country in the world, and also the highest number since it began its eradication campaign 15 years ago. There were 297, and epidemiologists estimate that there are 200 undetected infections for every case that is diagnosed.
In addition, the country was forced to cancel its first national vaccination drive of this year, because of threats polio workers would be shot by extremists. The Taliban is opposed to vaccination, casting it as a Western intrusion into Islamic affairs; since 2012, according to the BBC, more than 60 members of vaccination teams, or their guards have been murdered.
And this morning, according to the Pakistani paper The News International, the first polio case of 2015 has been diagnosed in Sindh province, in a 1-year-old child.
Among the endemic countries, Pakistan is clearly now the major challenge -- more of one than Nigeria was, even though Nigeria in its worst outbreaks had more cases. I say that because the barriers to vaccination in Nigeria depended on internal sectarian politics. The children who were not being vaccinated were always technically reachable by vaccinators, once local communities decided to let them in; and there was never a threat to the lives of the vaccination teams. In Pakistan, though, the conflict is bigger than one party versus another, and the areas where children are not being vaccinated are literal no-go zones.
Meanwhile, the performance of the vaccination teams remains poor, the equipment they are using seems unreliable, and there are frequent suggestions of corruption. As BBC Asia said last week, quoting a regional polio official:
In an ideal world - where all of the population is accessible, vaccinators are not cheating on numbers, a perfect cold chain is maintained and at least 90 percent of the 40 million or so children are inoculated repeatedly during five to six monthly campaigns - Pakistan can eradicate polio in half a year, says Dr Imtiaz Ali Shah, the chief minister's focal person on polio in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
But there's a technical hitch. ""Most of our infected children are zero-dose -- children who have never had OPV drops before,"" he says.
""When we are able to restrict the incidence of polio to only those children who've had multiple doses of OPV and were infected only due to low immunity, we can then say that we are close to victory.""
In the meantime, the WHO continues to recommend that anyone within Pakistan who is leaving the country should be required to accept a polio vaccination on the way out, or be prevented from leaving. That was the organization's emergency recommendation last summer, and it is still in force -- though it is an open question how well it is being respected, since emergencies never stay ""emergent"" for long. Given the other successes last year, it looks at this point as though Pakistan might be the last hold-out of polio. The country may have to ask itself whether it wants to be responsible for returning the disease to the world.",16,31,28.483870967741936,0,0.6740172574917476,0.5437552310125802,0.2769705466926098,0.28709069453179836,0.2903225806451613,0.3570257913995781,0.3303634181466671,0.1853875875746895,0.26800134658484914,0.17247522173120694,0.157438667252293,0.11355043687867802,0.1191967744188129,0.09344197316641907,0.7195209915112503,0.1480904165072648,0.10738083310620385,0.9116143860406548,0.18036544863176937,0.15210343959153805,1.3148184653328525,0.2606262445454663,0.1536142995875488,1.318573656523478,0.26123568367373706,0.043233082706766915,0.01730769230769231,0.015384615384615385,0.021445221445221447,3.162937310689152,3.5692284493657103,0,0,1.1209441384528493,6.882687073189132,9.421836858233238,-0.007098352301188288,-0.08920782253489182,1.201801017549364,,0.36832351812957054,0.9954238773382196,0.4062517670639495,0.5358890351786217,0.36761391390713655,-0.6741247462682961,-1.0631016412294667,-0.5058186020409976,-0.4825454529197739,-1.5795603534785163,-1.974191029013305,-0.31706332382374536,-1.3675461420804993,-0.049161084158191835,-0.22730435028327833,-0.1808480236288431,-0.7396352550867096,-0.7432078946041486,-0.7983109656863493,-0.5666938089238011,-0.40624753467394686,-0.5713162522926788,-0.5815699558835115,-0.38803068541731184,-0.6695361900881812,0.4446965094523141,-0.48979996061173964,-0.668911046588561,-0.861106505380619,0.167935642565166,0.09900048856446075,,,-0.548304752606136,1.0287830469641641,0.39378434795228956,0,-0.3724892154235101
40,yes_101.txt,"Anti-vaxxers, stop using autistic people like me as pawns
The ""vaccines cause autism"" argument is flawed - so why are so many anti-vaxxers still clinging onto it?
Autism is a mysterious thing.
There's still some debate in the scientific community about what causes it, even if those working in the field have some explanations.
I myself, have autism , and I believe that in my case genetics and a very premature birth perhaps have some role to play.
One thing is sure, however: Vaccines do not cause autism.
There is no serious evidence to prove this fact outside some anecdotes. The controversial research that first linked the two has since been withdrawn from public record .
What is more worrying is how this ""Jenny McCarthy"" argument seems to be taking hold among a coalition of people who don't vaccinate their children whether for religious or ""health"" reasons.
Others see the ""vaccines cause autism"" argument as a way to sue pharmaceutical companies.
Considering that autism is a condition involving multiple challenges for parents, this can be an easy scapegoat for a very complex condition.
But what I find worse is how some crooks are using people with autism as props for their cause.
Vaccines are helping people with autism not contract terrible diseases like measles, polio or the mumps. Because of vaccines, these atrocious diseases are getting rarer and rarer.
Not being vaccinated puts you at higher risk of these terrible conditions that kill more people annually than Ebola.
The anti-vaccine movement is already causing the worst measles outbreak in America in 20 years.
Instead of finding some scapegoat and using autistic people as props, anti-vaxxers should think about what tools autistic people might need to have a better life.

Parents who dont immunize their children against contagious diseases put everyone at risk
Parents who refuse to get their children vaccinated against contagious diseases often appear to believe that their personal preferences are more important than public health. They are wrong, and they could be dangerously wrong.
Ohio, and the nation, need to increase rates of child immunization; instead, rates are dropping. To reverse that trend, states need to tighten their rules for granting exemptions from vaccination.
Click here to read more Blade editorials
A woman infected with measles who visited Disneyland before Christmas started an outbreak that has spread from California to 10 other states a graphic reminder of how highly contagious the disease is. In California, the Los Angeles Times reports, students who are not immunized are barred from school, infants who may have been exposed to measles are in quarantine, and infected adults remain hospitalized.
A Toledo Public Schools student who was feared to have measles last week turned out not to, fortunately. But last summer, a measles epidemic swept 27 states and included a record 644 cases most of them in central Ohio.
In the 1960s, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), measles killed roughly 450 people every year in this country. By 2000, though, effective vaccination regimens essentially eliminated the disease in America.
But as more parents reject immunization for their children, incidences of measles and other illnesses are increasing. In Ohio, the share of students in first through 12th grades who were immunized against major childhood diseases fell from almost 97 percent in 1998 to less than 90 percent in 2013.
Near-universal vaccination rates are needed to ensure herd immunity a level of immunization high enough to protect children who are too young for vaccination, and others who cant be vaccinated for medical reasons or for whom a vaccine doesnt work. Yet as a national anti-immunization movement continues to gain adherents, such immunity is increasingly threatened.
Scientists have debunked any purported link between the vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella and childhood autism. Yet some Hollywood celebrities continue to promote the canard, and thats enough for those who want to believe it. The rumor that vaccines include mercury is equally false, but it also enjoys credence among critics of vaccination.
Vaccinations carry some risks: The CDC estimates that the measles vaccine will cause a severe allergic reaction in one of every million people who receive it. But among people who are infected with measles, more than one of every 1,000 die. One of every 20 children with measles also develops pneumonia, and one of every 1,000 gets encephalitis.
Ohio and Michigan are among a minority of states that allow parents to opt out of immunizing their children on the basis of personal beliefs, as well as medical and religious reasons. Michigan requires parents who seek nonmedical waivers to meet with a public health official to discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination. Ohio has no such mandate.
Growing numbers of pediatricians, in the Toledo area and across the state, refuse to treat children whose parents wont immunize them. Although that decision is understandable, it also increases the risk of driving communicable diseases further underground.
Its past time for elected officials to stand up to the selfishness, recklessness, and science-phobic superstition that too often accompany anti-immunization sentiments. Ohio, Michigan, and every other state that has personal-belief exemptions for vaccinations of public school students need to repeal them. Religious exemptions must be narrowly defined, and require more than vague assertions of individual rights.
Vaccination opponents complain that vaccine manufacturers are shielded from product liability lawsuits. Although that is an issue for Congress to examine, it does not justify an expansion, or maintenance, of vaccination exemptions.
With an infinitesimal number of exceptions, vaccination is safe and effective. Protecting the lives and health of all Americans cannot be allowed to depend on the irrational whims of the few.",17,35,21.37142857142857,0,0.6070923971779206,0.4044104410718907,0.38908831030130386,0.3879943495871974,0.02857142857142857,0.38072858000133225,0.3661307912585824,0.2997606355735722,0.36972945473775576,0.22334009210405115,0.1867516035433437,0.1585542421037745,0.20614364273053962,0.1203225701984998,1.0141839048139776,0.20183713717700608,0.14405821712272482,1.24130797834582,0.24585367315850265,0.15297563504828088,1.3240563557207399,0.2631465303719612,0.158137119580247,1.3360636652386857,0.2673800086203716,0.016666666666666666,0.011904761904761904,0.022988505747126436,0.02115987460815047,3.1034002732280515,3.52954035565614,0,0,1.132197439657117,6.649006845447939,9.64322614735621,0.09391666121572108,0.08360314258505559,-0.2102445673001356,,-0.2007909432691537,-0.11031715100674264,1.421283176589787,1.4651918963630806,-0.6691618226176087,-0.053626323474112746,0.08860267810972629,0.5753329068611387,1.1418175956943084,0.07364223891210289,-0.48529434644421937,0.4498142732707791,0.853026096248885,0.5951332980147279,0.6373277832831143,0.5993254538375639,0.7900822001641101,0.9397686458062491,0.8564409837701797,-0.47429305962420115,-0.22089815397892026,-0.3554209417532137,0.03795175907239848,0.0005413197342646017,-0.019260146521094947,-0.4370826914807871,-0.6712884382738266,-0.4367869876358517,-0.8767712126687293,-0.6761231719693518,-0.5530891580769595,,,-0.3169890641454308,0.2704525892871824,1.1690672125629713,0,3.2853272154750246
42,yes_104.txt,"CDC says 15 children have died from the flu
Nationally the CDC says 15 children have died from the flu this season. We typically see about 100 kids die from complications from the flu. So, it has to be taken seriously.
Local hospitals are seeing more cases. So, now is the time to do what you can to protect yourself and your family.
The flu has now hit the epidemic threshold, so chances are you or someone you know caught the virus this season.
At the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Dr. Julia Sammons, Director of Infection Control, says their numbers are up.
""Particularly in the past week, we've seen a dramatic rise in the number of positive tests for influenza,"" Dr. Sammons said.
The flu hit my family as well. My brother-in-law Jason, who lives in Virginia, caught the nasty bug over the holidays.
He says, ""It knocked me out for several days and hit me hard.""
The flu typically comes on quickly, with fatigue, sore throat, body aches, cough, fever and chills.
Dr. Sammons says this year could be especially bad because the predominant strain going around is known to cause severe illness. And it has changed, so the vaccine doesn't protect against all cases.
But if you haven't gotten a flu shot yet, it is still recommended.
Dr. Sammons tells us, ""The vaccine includes three to four different strains. And so during the course of the season we may see other strains predominate that the influenza vaccine could be protective against.""
It's also vital to wash your hands frequently, disinfect common surfaces, and if you are sick stay away from others.
The flu can be contagious a day before symptoms and up to 5 to 7 days after your illness.
In some cases, Tamiflu can help, but it has to be given within the first 48 hours, and there have been spot shortages reported where demand is up because of local flu outbreaks.
If you or someone in your family gets sick, be on the lookout for severe symptoms, such as rapid breathing, shortness of breath and dehydration. These are signs to go to the emergency room.
Statement from Genentech:
We anticipate having ample supply of both Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) formulations (oral suspension and 75mg capsules) for the 2014-15 flu season.
We have produced sufficient supply of all Tamiflu formulations for a severe flu season and are currently working with distributors and national retail pharmacies to provide consistent access to Tamiflu.
Flu activity is unpredictable and, as the manufacturer of Tamiflu, we do our best each season to anticipate flu spikes and work with our network of national distributors and pharmacies to provide Tamiflu to those areas of the country that need it most.
Despite robust supply nationally, from time-to-time, spot shortages may occur in local areas.
If Tamiflu Oral Suspension is unavailable at a local pharmacy, pharmacists may mix Tamiflu 75 mg capsules into an oral suspension (liquid) for those people who need it. The current healthcare provider instructions for dosing and compounding are found in the Tamiflu package, and also may be accessed at www.tamiflu.com.",22,30,20.3,0,0.7167024630410918,0.36813432017619585,0.11896901950240135,0.11304696151196506,0.2,0.4207010174678131,0.40691950051174436,0.13857488564984954,0.3133169461888346,0.20771925259720195,0.20339291662933282,0.06318376531176594,0.17017199916652206,0.06019099393435827,0.5012888702000218,0.10049358206454932,0.1263404336633405,1.0738626799753686,0.2137165587031167,0.16744173104450782,1.4114328997235968,0.2827830949164981,0.16760804264369725,1.4071000890958167,0.2815685157545514,0.05434782608695652,0.05,0.01818181818181818,0.06103896103896104,3.220632249331926,3.6087038637358284,0,0,1.1820932234762374,6.669559746304111,9.253844114845963,0.598991728800268,-0.13241056381487867,-0.4229571489235048,,0.7313092255631634,-0.398178614938369,-1.0241773432672876,-1.0670195906561466,0.009853272430287809,0.9927836504711002,1.4019933059355003,-0.9483321505329562,0.24104006202820788,-0.4340640066508085,0.35997054279470864,-1.1753256834551324,-0.06566867236492577,-0.8461455817643035,-0.8676648983655294,-0.8717513453727505,0.051119939007041905,0.08501588282671124,0.0444025878712492,1.05825116444579,1.5322281160011015,1.3267065993785416,1.3352491328252254,1.5787432581336387,1.4823606765103234,0.8136115155851129,0.6083591330385151,-0.5835208008004609,1.3124740660533023,0.9858789530175703,0.747595737205157,,,0.7086368722712761,0.33715010521956384,-0.1945092223601872,0,-6.317943409477561
43,yes_105.txt,"Scrap the religious exemption for vaccination
Dr. Jeffrey Gunzenhauser, interim health officer with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, discussed Californias measles outbreak during a news conference Wednesday.
FEBRUARY 06, 2015
THE RECENT measles epidemic in the western United States provides a good reminder that it is time to end the religious exemption for vaccination.
Government requires vaccination, not to protect the individual, but to protect the community. What gives me and my family protection is not that I was vaccinated, but that everybody was. However, combine the failure rate of a vaccine with a high enough refusal rate, and the disease can spread.
With all due respect to religion, we need to understand that a religious reason to refuse a vaccine is no reason at all. Imagine if I insisted that my child attend school with a fever during a flu epidemic, claiming religious belief. The claim to a religious exemption for vaccines is no different. It is based simply on belief, or a claim to a belief.
Indeed, we do not accept refusals based on seeing the science differently, or an extreme libertarian point of view, or distrust of government, or a superstitious fear of technology that we dont understand. These are reasons, at least, but they are judged not good enough. Religious objections count precisely because they come without any reason except a statement of belief, perhaps endorsed by a so-called religious authority.
The alternative is simple and clear. If you want to refuse vaccines and avoid participation in mutual protection of the community, then home-school your children. Dont send them to where they place my family and community at risk.

45,yes_107.txt,"NEW VACCINATION EXEMPTIONS PROPOSALS PROMPTED BY MEASLES OUTBREAKS
Getting vaccination exemptions for your children was fairly easy in the past; you just chose from the options, lets say, personal beliefs, and the family doctor took a pass on your kids. But after the highly publicized measles outbreaks which infected more than 150 people in 17 states, it might get a bit more difficult to keep your children unimmunized and in school.
The outbreaks might have a lasting effect on public health legacy, as lawmakers from at least 10 states are starting to propose tougher legislation that will render exemptions more difficult to obtain. Democrats and Republicans have united under the conviction that the recent measles cases could have been prevented if vaccination rates were higher, which is not possible if exemptions are available for all kinds of reasons. Approaches differed from one statehouse to another, ranging from requiring schools to post immunization rates to eliminating philosophical and religious exemptions from the list.
Lawmakers are positive about the chances that these bills will pass as laws, even though very few are far enough in the process in order to predict the outcome. Many believe that the constant presence of measles updates in the news has helped them make their case. The fact that the proposals have received bipartisan support is also a good sign that legislative committees will be more inclined to pass them in the coming weeks and months. Democrats have introduced legislation in 8 states, while Republicans in 2, Vermont and Texas.
The latest measles outbreak, and the largest one, has originated mid-December in Disneyland, California. The majority of cases could be traced to this state, which also permits both religious and philosophical exemptions. The contagious disease spread to 17 states, 10 of which allow parents to pass on vaccinating their kids on philosophical grounds.
Religious exemptions are much more difficult to obtain, because families need to present extensive documented religious objections or health history that prohibits vaccinations. However, in the light of recent events, 6 of the 10 states which allow easy opt-out laws have already proposed new laws.
Even though almost 80 percent of Americans who took the Reuters/Ipsos poll believe that all children should be vaccinated, the proposals have already received some opposition from a small but vocal community of advocates who support anti-vaccine parents.
Their reasons are varied, ranging from fear that vaccines may cause autism to opposing what they believe to be an intrusive government who should not have a say in parental decisions. Even though links between autism and vaccines have been thoroughly debunked by experts, some parents still refuse to immunize their children for this reason.
This is not the first time local and national anti-vaccine advocates have prevented lawmakers efforts to curb exemptions. Last year, Colorado introduced a measure requiring parents to consult with a doctor before refusing vaccination or to effectuate an online course about immunization. Anti-vaxers, which is the name of these anti-vaccine organizations, lobbied and testified in hearings, bringing the end of the measure in the Senate.
The new crop of proposals will have a hard time gaining traction in the states with easy exemption rules, because decades-old court decisions will most likely make it impossible to change the legislation. For example, Marylands Supreme Court has ruled in 1982 that exemptions based on religious reasons could not be denied, for it would lead to discrimination.
But not all states are the same; since 1979, Mississippis Supreme Court has advocated for mandatory vaccination for school enrollment. The lawmakers believed that exemptions, irrespective of their grounds, represent an unnecessary risk for children. This year, however, Mississippi lawmakers have started a new attempt of re-introducing philosophical exemptions, but such efforts have been constantly shot down in the past.
Health and local authorities are concerned that many of the exemptions are requested by parents who think its easier this way. Tom Shanahan, public information officer for the Idaho Department of Health, said that less than 1 percent of children in the state are completely unvaccinated, but the rate of exemption is 6.3 percent and growing. It is very easy for a parent to write a waiver to exempt their child from one or more vaccinations. This year, Idaho is not among the states to introduce new legislation regarding exemptions.
But even if these proposals pass, it is likely that tougher laws will make parents who do not want to vaccinate their children even more adamant. It is not surprising that some parents have decided to home-school their children after the school denied their appeals to exemption. A lot of parents believe that these proposals represent a violation of the Constitution.

46,yes_108.txt,"Anti-Vaccination Book Teaches Children That Measles Are Marvelous
Although self-published in 2012, Stephanie Messengers anti-vaccination book, Melanies Marvelous Measles, has become relevant again due to the recent measles outbreak and controversy over vaccines. The anti-vaccination book teaches children that measles are marvelous. The Inquisitr has been covering the progression of the measles outbreak and controvery over vaccines.
Describing the measles as a positive experience, Messengers book follows the story of a vaccinated girl, Melanie, and her friend, Tina, who is not vaccinated and heroically portrayed to not fear contamination. The author develops the book with the extreme belief that there are benefits to catching the deadly disease and building a case against vaccines.
In recent days, the book has resurfaced in social media discussions as an example of extreme ignorance on the subject of vaccines.
Anti-vaccine book Melanies Marvelous Measles stirs outrage online Yahoo News http://t.co/fo12X4yWOr
 San Diego BookReview (@SDBookReview) February 7, 2015
Messenger herself states, Often today, we are being bombarded with messages from vested interests to fear all diseases in order for someone to sell some potion or vaccine, when, in fact, history shows that in industrialized countries, these diseases are quite benign and, according to natural health sources, beneficial to the body.
Seeming to mock the title of vaccination proponent Roald Dahl, whose daughter died from the measles, Messengers book bears a title that is a play on words of Dahls Georges Marvelous Medicine. Dahl is also known for publishing a pro-immunization letter in the 1988, making him a target for people like Messenger.
Toting melon juice and carrot juice as natural treatments to build immunity, Messengers book has stirred some concerns on the internet. While many agree that certain vitamins and homeopathic supplements are helpful to the body, they are not scientifically proven to prevent deadly strains of a virus, like vaccines.
The argument about vaccines is a heated topic, bringing most people to agree that vaccines save lives, despite 20 U.S. states allowing personal belief exemptions. However, the extremist followers of the anti-vaxx movement cite various theories from their own homeopathic research. Even some medical doctors subscribe to the anti-vaccination movement, creating much alarm about consistency of treatment in the medical field.
Should doctors who oppose vaccines lose their licenses? http://t.co/iaTIOccqlo
 Forbes Tech News (@ForbesTech) February 7, 2015
Anti-vaccination research has been proven false or fabricated several times, especially with regards to Autism. Many members of the anti-vaxx movement are not informed of these updates as they passionately follow updated information that vaccines are bad. In Ontario, 20 percent of people believe vaccines are bad for them, despite the lack of any evidence to support that claim.
The anti-vaccination movement is an international community of parents and medical professionals. Recently, anti-vaccination advocate Dr. Sherri Tenpenny cancelled her speaking tour in Australia due to threats against her and her opinion about vaccines. In Australia, Messengers book was not well-received by the medical community.
Dr. Tenpenny elaborated on why she cancelled her tour.
Its difficult to grasp why pro-vaccine extremists are so adamantly against freedom of speech. They have taken it one step further. They have blocked the freedom to hear information that is not in line with their pro-vaccine message.
The pro-vaccine message is founded on the fact that deadly diseases, like the measles, are close to being eradicated as a result of vaccines.

47,yes_109.txt,"Sure... don't vaccinate the kids. What's the worse that can happen?
I do not understand the mindset of people who refuse to get their children vaccinated. It's ignorance and stupidity raised to a level of absurdity that knows no bounds. To jump on a disproven bandwagon and to maintain that position in the face of overwhelming science and experience has to be a uniquely American idiocy.
USA Today, not usually a source for in-depth reporting on anything, has a great article on the facts and myths regarding vaccination. If you've not read it, and think vaccines are dangerous, I suggest you drop whatever you are doing, right now, and go read it.
People of my generation received a full range of vaccinations when we were children, and as a result few of us saw or dealt with serious outbreaks of disease. Outbreaks that used to devastate this country in my grandparents and great-grandparents times vanished because of universal (or as nearly so as is possible) vaccinations. Now, because of anti-vaccination nonsense, we're seeing measles spread across the country. Children are suffering for the ignorance of their parents. That ignorance extends even to the absurdity of blaming President Obama for the outbreak, by claiming immigration policy has resulted in infected children coming into the United States from Central American nations.
It doesn't seem to penetrate the thick skulls of certain politicians, as well as the anti-vaxxers, that proper immunization would prevent the very thing we're seeing now, and even if claims about immigration policies were correct (and they're not, but that's another fact-free subject from the right), properly vaccinated populations can resist outbreaks, whatever the source.
To risk the health of children based on fear and ignorance borders on criminal. When the science is clear, and the information so readily available, one wonders at the staggering level of ignorance still operating in this country.
I don't have children, but if I did they would be fully vaccinated, on the schedule their pediatrician recommended. In my family, science and facts are held in high esteem, and my nieces, nephews, and their children have all had their shots. To risk the most important thing in your life, your children, to ignorance and the nonsense of conspiracy nuts is unforgivable. To risk other people's children is beyond the pale.",7,19,24.0,0,0.5438733713494407,0.3773277442254213,0.3628703941191946,0.33201719692775183,0.3684210526315789,0.4393580888814114,0.37945672066540437,0.4183109286978104,0.4105266607011713,0.22833226109914323,0.1801132078898463,0.22380034928898054,0.20684878258370856,0.1850690816893875,1.3678964341244981,0.2914684686930323,0.1625318193523144,1.3704722668903502,0.2732600559995541,0.17035857428923684,1.3959433691879506,0.28162559232545264,0.16383641539239283,1.3754304414276706,0.27407103276398365,0.07692307692307693,0.020957613814756672,0.02127659574468085,0.026595744680851064,3.0516614081958497,3.5066471561459327,0,0,1.1507210179124014,6.195402344414628,9.238452378432376,-0.9162334739533726,-0.6076407178947341,0.31161029961586467,,-0.7383917939218674,-0.32522614813621065,1.1839255308376286,0.9496533056269801,0.6769558219510281,1.4811938363189991,0.5176957068044523,1.6959712961896527,1.7932547948808026,0.2358969869109194,-0.8224794434244516,1.5616264333247478,0.8710349562859455,2.1470264188813317,1.6752297556046847,1.9003906486517859,1.5605676791512284,1.5991095385404812,1.5489435788782362,1.3672627504599395,1.221445591908467,1.2275514247087118,0.8186234464890787,0.875145066890005,0.6888750425045294,1.5629179562089142,-0.3671963643218553,-0.48904648631149883,-0.5783578346929521,-1.4096270033108833,-0.9292326556292951,,,0.06376980643841956,-1.2015680099647983,-0.24840952415586354,0,7.674453768827117
48,yes_110.txt,"Mercury News editorial: California should end personal belief vaccine exemption
State Sen. Richard Pan believes a child should not have to die for California to tough its vaccination laws.
The Sacramento Democrat is a pediatrician who was the former director of the UC-Davis Pediatric Residency Program. For years he's been warning that the state's lax immunization laws leave California vulnerable to contagious diseases, and he's right. With the first measles case reported in Contra Costa County Wednesday and the possibility that BART riders have been exposed, the peril hits home in the Bay Area.
It's time to change the law. Parents should not be able to opt out of vaccinations under a ""personal belief"" exemption, as they can now, and it may be necessary to eliminate the religious exemption, too. The tougher state laws are, the higher vaccination rates go.
Measles was all but eliminated in the United States until the past decade, when parents began resisting immunization despite overwhelming scientific evidence. The disease is still life-threatening; about 25 percent of the more than 120 victims so far have been hospitalized.
The Centers for Disease Control has a goal of immunizing at least 90 percent of all children before they enter kindergarten. Clusters of unvaccinated kids create a pool in which disease can spread, threatening those who can't be vaccinated for various reasons as well as the small minority for whom vaccine does not work.
The national average immunization rate is 91.1 percent. California's rate hovers just above the 90 percent rate. But California had a nearly 70 percent increase in exemptions from 2009-2013, leaving the state vulnerable to this outbreak.
California is one of only 20 states to permit a personal belief exemption for philosophical reasons, and 80 percent of parents who decline vaccines for their kids use this excuse. Today more than 10,000 kindergarten students have waivers due to parents' personal beliefs. Another 2,760 California parents sought religious exemptions for their kindergarteners.
Pan is teaming with Sen. Ben Allen, D-Santa Monica, on a bill to increase vaccination rates. Eliminating the personal belief exemption is essential. The Legislature should discuss ending the religious exemption as well, although all but two states -- West Virginia and Mississippi -- still allow it. The danger is that parents now using ""personal belief"" might suddenly claim they've gotten religion.
A spokesman for Brown told the Los Angeles Times last week that the governor is open to a bill that eliminates all exemptions except for medical reasons, although he has supported the religious exemption in the past. So it's up to Pan and Allen to sell the tightest possible regulation. Santa Clara County has an immunization rate of 92.53 percent, and Contra Costa County's is 93.96 percent. But families cross county borders all the time, and Santa Cruz (84.38 percent) and Alameda (88.94 percent) have troubling levels. Remember Disneyland, and support strong legislation.",10,27,20.37037037037037,0,0.5373247171250674,0.3531068016932826,0.33432254921644927,0.32422253939012685,0.037037037037037035,0.40106739136187924,0.40030952538798714,0.3866793395082156,0.36548283645676244,0.16781977414274993,0.17414825087435593,0.174169832341097,0.17180413447586554,0.1478248961702123,1.2175750277502269,0.24887221323988387,0.14824700345182315,1.234471976828348,0.2514794974273812,0.15762004179498892,1.3380822234697691,0.2697391143062666,0.16001274063920096,1.3488036094971494,0.2729576999022008,0.006666666666666667,0.009523809523809523,0,0.018357487922705314,3.152054031747876,3.5606871410289833,0,0,1.1340214988949167,6.87064048544875,9.21816602454463,-0.6131884334026445,-0.2620187876548392,-0.4089863966489824,,-0.7940801256466437,-0.5174263008248814,0.9254744315837048,0.8778660393709564,-0.6356302129856138,0.4788089347888683,1.1891530485049164,1.3969625613552272,1.074008905033845,-1.730871031468266,-1.125458463466953,0.7159083570602223,-0.023984889757238132,1.254329747376148,1.2341402514750726,1.2820744364286345,0.9647854876464305,0.9048731232585547,0.9985939241423284,0.017737322018197162,0.06051738483301497,0.20931974789064536,0.29486845638215653,0.283582098423309,0.5710470150448309,-0.7689976925867374,-0.7512664114808479,-1.1385573984231125,-1.0306140503402639,0.013642988560944912,-0.041336277819676075,,,-0.2794948648233057,0.9896899046691858,-0.31945028053980035,0,4.421345626411875
49,yes_111.txt,"Politics rages unchecked
It will be fascinating to see how New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie reacts when pharmaceutical companies produce vaccines for the Ebola virus, which could come as he campaigns next year for the Republican presidential nomination.
Mr. Christie infamously had attempted to quarantine a nurse from Maine who had landed at Newark Liberty International Airport after courageously volunteering to work at an Ebola treatment center in West Africa even though she did not have Ebola.
But while visiting England this week, Mr. Christie said that vaccination of children against measles, mumps, rubella and other potentially lethal diseases should be somewhat voluntary, even though no one is somewhat infected.
That is an extraordinary view for an educated governor of a highly urban state, where an outbreak of infectious disease could pose a particularly serious challenge.
But there is an outbreak of politics. Mr. Christie often is perceived as being too moderate to appeal to the far-right, anti-science wing of the Republican Party, which has a disproportionate role in the nomination process. So, when that wings darling, Sen. Rand Paul, irresponsibly repeated the disproven notion that childhood vaccines cause mental disorders, Mr. Christie had to respond with something.
One would think that public health would be above that level of politics but, apparently, there is no cure.
High-profile politicians like Mr. Christie must stop pandering and insist on promoting the safety, efficacy and mandatory administration of life-saving vaccines.",8,10,27.0,0,0.7830954458978441,0.6132813894086414,0.05227983370423317,0.05750413239002228,0.3,0.3727996754646301,0.3867677010008349,0.05516672662148873,0.2503711660858244,0.19982768803834916,0.16659343549838432,0.028726247139275074,0.13047549165785313,0.021522921806316413,0.17604792879655,0.03594818376068376,0.11408825476687917,0.9832912419693101,0.1975941693172102,0.15543923092742024,1.3340397797441532,0.2661827316817903,0.15740595313979272,1.3404328505255476,0.2667184173887668,0,0.0,0,0.006153846153846154,3.107172358251366,3.5380618028342443,0,0,1.1494120902571607,6.403032244229427,9.538707174813055,-0.8152184604364633,-0.9964653894146157,0.9072055281612995,,1.2959007167069823,1.5471339621893125,-1.6279319677092974,-1.5785581468458323,0.40594541120822736,-0.26119146874757726,0.753108232196602,-1.7367771431779244,-0.7640587363474688,-0.6905544860540267,-1.5091914146466063,-1.7624915598913966,-1.0794942907454252,-1.7729710392428477,-1.8220224248585761,-1.8086756306441911,-0.45988629617947774,-0.3773212961571674,-0.3629768373464168,-0.2132986879566552,-0.020590358339585713,-0.09533074969847541,-0.06220112957666221,0.09761063030118868,-0.08927872989408141,-0.9902743599907043,-1.0711783043089333,-1.1385573984231125,-1.7005583122792367,-0.6226461810259806,-0.4130787176686403,,,0.03686432366306857,-0.5277751158207323,0.8030523580936006,0,-3.6827204376510365
50,yes_112.txt,"HPV vaccination rates among girls lowest in states with highest cervical cancer rates
The percentage of girls who receive HPV vaccinations is considerably lower in states that have higher rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality, according to study results presented at the American Association for Cancer Research Conference on the Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved in San Antonio.
Cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates vary widely by state, Jennifer L. Moss, MSPH, a doctoral student in the department of health behavior at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health, said in a press release. Our data show that adolescent girls remain vulnerable to disease in areas where women already have a higher risk for developing and dying from cervical cancer. If more adolescents both girls and boys in these states received an HPV vaccine, their risk for HPV-related cancers would drop dramatically.
Moss and colleagues used the National Immunization SurveyTeen to calculate HPV vaccination rates in different states, and they used the United States Cancer Statistics database to calculate cancer rates.
The researchers observed an inverse association between cervical cancer incidence and HPV vaccination initiation rates.
For example, in Massachusetts a state with a low risk for cervical cancer about six of every 100,000 women develop cervical cancer each year and 69% of teen girls have initiated HPV vaccination, Moss and colleagues determined. In Arkansas, the cervical cancer incidence rate is considerably higher 10 per 100,000 women but the HPV vaccination initiation rate is only 41%.
Results showed HPV vaccine initiation among adolescent girls was lower in states with higher levels of cervical cancer incidence (r=-.29) and mortality (r=-.46). In addition, vaccination initiation was lower among girls who lived in states with higher proportions of non-Hispanic black residents (r=-.28) and lower proportions of higher-income residents (r=.32), results showed.
The proportion of girls who completed the three-dose HPV vaccination course was lower in states with higher levels of cervical cancer mortality (r=-.30) and higher in states with greater levels of adolescents contact with the health care system.
HPV vaccination initiation among boys was lower in states with higher proportions of non-Hispanic white residents and lower proportions of residents of other races. However, HPV-related cancer incidence or mortality was not associated with HPV vaccination initiation among boys, Moss and colleagues concluded.
Teens do not visit their health care providers as often as younger children, so increasing the frequency and efficiency of preventive visits is really important for HPV vaccination and cancer prevention, Moss said. We know that a health care providers recommendation is the single biggest influence on whether an adolescent receives an HPV vaccine. So, we hope that the findings of our study impress upon clinicians especially those practicing in states with higher cancer rates that cancer prevention means recommending HPV vaccination to adolescent patients at every visit.

51,yes_113.txt,"Mumps outbreak spreading across northwest U.S.
SEATTLE An outbreak of mumps that started at an Idaho university and infected 21 people across the state has now spread to neighboring Washington state, health officials said on Monday.
The spread of mumps, a highly contagious virus that leads to painful swelling of the salivary glands, comes as a wider measles outbreak has infected more than 100 people in California and over a dozen more in 19 other U.S. states and Mexico since December.
Complications of mumps can include inflammation of the testicles in males who have reached puberty, inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, inflammation of the ovaries and breasts in females who have reached puberty, and temporary or permanent deafness.
The mumps outbreak began in September at the University of Idaho campus in Moscow, near the border with Washington state, and later spread to the capital, Boise, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare said.
Mumps spreads easily from sharing saliva through kissing, shared eating utensils or water bottles, public health officials said.
So far, there have been 21 confirmed and probable cases, including six around Boise, the states most populous city, a statement said. Then on Friday, two infections were reported in Washington state, the statement added.
Public health officials were urging students on the Moscow campus and anyone who might have come into close contact with an infected person to ensure their vaccinations are up to date. Mumps and measles can be prevented through a single vaccine, the MMR vaccine that also covers rubella, health officials said.
The MMR vaccine will also protect against measles, which is increasing in the western U.S. because of a large outbreak linked to an amusement park in California, the Idaho health agency said in a statement.
The measles outbreak has renewed debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement, in which a small minority of parents have chosen not to immunize their children over fear of potential side-effects fueled by now-debunked research suggesting a link to autism. Federal health officials have urged parents to get their children vaccinated.",10,13,29.76923076923077,0,0.814908541738987,0.6142258202800384,0.1271288961172104,0.1271288961172104,0.6923076923076923,0.34381598790804313,0.35952402411267975,0.10524468235597606,0.33640873593174747,0.2265319435229135,0.2079170726251495,0.0759093568202049,0.20014126198159324,0.04308094991548595,0.3604465445557654,0.07437686700212295,0.14722508073344234,1.2153855591891582,0.2472893076247334,0.1573224281565498,1.308478900607123,0.26977312519806906,0.15116728828751577,1.2873260192429135,0.2599318724682477,0.0047619047619047615,0.05222222222222222,0.046511627906976744,0.035940803382663845,3.2728700006865523,3.6449776796110176,0,0,1.1288022064617809,6.943947089159855,9.800923572651705,-0.6131884334026445,-0.8668571655746552,1.4569857391263163,,1.5664323669810045,1.5546282930744764,-0.9503038481555436,-0.9373277364563941,1.9598453402601443,-1.0199347844724895,-0.12413428289089899,-1.263397633298951,0.6097626369961138,0.17738332783083327,0.589766725159865,-0.9584779971586846,0.6997287974064909,-1.256251995209447,-1.2809398475381673,-1.2508548172934784,0.9221637723267027,0.8074432857459727,0.8927164966409331,-0.013791990569892667,-0.5334448001157098,0.21223322380286905,-0.9167538985476882,-1.0822531567760951,-0.8075232268461298,-0.8322195975592994,0.683005241365068,0.28130366526274064,-0.06534142751373594,1.7264555144755167,1.3435875716702186,,,-0.38677931411812205,1.2275817917164518,1.7213076217948338,0,-6.995573732088912
52,yes_114.txt,"End Vaccine Exemptions Now (Even In Your Precious Alternative School)
I got a measles vaccine booster shot this week because I needed to be sure I couldn't bring harm to my community. And I mean that literally, as measles has now arrived in my Toronto neighbourhood. The proximity of measles also prompted me to start poking around the Toronto Star's interactive map of Immunization Exemptions in Toronto's Schools and what I found sadly didn't surprise me -- alternative schools host scary percentages of unvaccinated kids. Unfortunately, anyone in Ontario can get a vaccine exemption.
I got a measles vaccine booster shot this week because I needed to be sure I couldn't bring harm to my community. And I mean that literally, as measles has now arrived in my Toronto neighbourhood.
An infected parent dropped their kid off at a nearby YMCA daycare in late January, potentially exposing 120 children. At least one of those kids was unvaccinated and goes to a French Immersion school that also has kids who are in my son's daycare. One of his best friends in daycare has an infant sibling. Infants can't be vaccinated.
This is not theoretical for me anymore. This is not a bunch of kids who went to Disneyland in far off California, it's not an outbreak at religious schools in B.C.'s Fraser Valley, it's here in Canada's biggest city.
In fact, right now, a 15-day-old baby might have been exposed because of this absurdist anti-vaxxer movement.
The proximity of measles also prompted me to start poking around the Toronto Star's interactive map of Immunization Exemptions in Toronto's Schools (based on 2011/2012 stats) and what I found sadly didn't surprise me -- alternative schools host scary percentages of kids with vaccine exemptions.
(At many of the schools, both mainstream and alternative, the vaccine coverage rates and exemption rates don't add up to 100 per cent, leaving an ""unknown"" number of children who may or may not be vaccinated. This discrepancy could be explained, however, by Toronto Public Health's Dr. Barbara Yaffe statement to Global News last year that ""sometimes, students are coming from another country and immunization records could be in a different language and need to be translated. In other instances, families need to track down archived medical records from their doctors."")
Now the high exemption rate at alternative schools wasn't surprising because they are predominantly populated by upper middle-class white kids whose parents don't trust the mainstream school system to educate their children (though their Waldorf-inspired, social justice-focused alt-schools are still paid for by the public purse).
According to the Toronto District School Board's own study, ""Alternative schools tend to be less diverse than other schools in the TDSB in general...and largely serve students from more affluent families (e.g., families with high socioeconomic status, two-parent household, and parents with higher education).""
The vaccine exemption map has bigger dots for the higher percentages exemptions and these mostly belong to alternative schools with granola names like Grove, Da Vinci and Equinox Holistic -- and they are hosted within mainstream public schools.
One local alternative elementary school (which scores twice as high on the Learning Opportunities Index as its host school, meaning its children tend to come from more stable, wealthier, better educated families) had 36.5 per cent of its students, or 31 kids, claiming exemptions for the MMR (measles, mumps rubella) vaccine.
Its host school had an exemption rate of 1.6 per cent, which is six kids.
There's no way to know how many of these exemptions are medical, but all these students from both schools share the library, computer lab, gym, auditorium and school yard. That means the kids whose parents made a choice to get non-medical exemptions are a threat to those who have no choice and can't get vaccinated.
Unfortunately, anyone in Ontario can get a vaccine exemption.
Although the province claims it mandates immunizations, in actual fact anyone can get an exemption. Medical exemptions for children with immunodeficiency, cancer, HIV or other reasons like allergies that prevent them from getting vaccinated require a doctor's note.
But all anti-vaxxers have to do is sign a form that states ""The requirements of the Immunization of School Pupils Act conflict with my sincerely held convictions based on my religion or conscience.""
That's it. They don't even have to write a damn essay explaining what those sincerely held convictions are. And the Ontario government has the audacity to call their immunization policy mandatory. Same goes for the other two ""mandatory"" provinces, Manitoba and New Brunswick, which also allow exemptions for ""religious or ideological reasons.""
The rest of Canada doesn't even have that, relying instead on a policy of telling unvaccinated kids to stay home from school in case of an outbreak.
Well, enough is enough.
Measles were declared eradicated from Canada in 2002 and we now have annual outbreaks of this highly contagious kid killer. (Yes, it does kill. According to the World Health Organization, 2.6-million children died annually before the vaccine came into widespread use around the world in 1980 and by 2012, with an 84 per cent vaccination rate, that number was brought down to 122,000, which is 14 children dying every hour.)
You still can't force people to vaccinate any more than you can force them not to drink and drive -- in both cases, selfish people are gambling with other's lives -- but you can take away a drunk driver's license. We need to take a similar stand here.
Children with non-medical vaccine exemptions need to be removed from the public school system, from daycares and from extracurricular activities and athletics. This must be done to achieve the vaccination rate of 95 per cent needed for herd immunity to protect the children who medically can't get vaccines and the infants who are too young.
A 2008 Toronto Star article headlined ""Alternative school students less likely to be vaccinated,"" quoted one mother as saying her fellow parents are ""suspicious because the government insists on doing it, so they push the other way."" Another said, ""If a parent chooses not to vaccinate, then it's because they feel that's the best way to keep their child safe.""
The issue is obviously not new, but it still prompts the same question: What about other people's children? Ironically, most of these alternative schools even claim to focus on fostering community through activism and service.
Given how many anti-vaxxer parents consider themselves social progressives maybe it's time for them to stop just thinking about themselves and start making progressive choices that protect our whole society.",26,47,27.361702127659573,0,0.6556420642882586,0.43551557617921943,0.20996416164323306,0.20788002668473965,0.3617021276595745,0.38856023449198646,0.36613816383557274,0.22017236249687683,0.2833600547434195,0.22579010668441765,0.19759167462516078,0.12751069033665338,0.16385858017773028,0.0938597509025989,0.7777498305933681,0.15711914971711194,0.11874145801049664,1.018847588928752,0.20247882781368057,0.15674231509626046,1.342023066073587,0.2667777562620083,0.15968595047131753,1.3506088554514013,0.26969167471708766,0.03764880952380952,0.03952991452991453,0.05263157894736842,0.05016272023341937,3.1738483661368586,3.57144505130866,0,0,1.1648158821126176,6.606088280596961,9.171542781320921,1.0030517828679053,0.6020360379448978,0.9790148819575573,,0.21206487023605272,0.13651105186346263,-0.20037454508116553,-0.19362567096546257,0.6503426883265306,0.15139298210077132,0.08884007403863274,-0.17700326877899164,-0.23730233909198048,0.15327225518791626,0.06530712562523146,-0.07917664794966724,-0.22690970620169923,-0.03914747292417263,-0.056442924912989946,-0.049789270691595444,-0.26581339770380946,-0.19581792699236755,-0.23955162269329702,-0.07524940935695516,0.13958659927097344,-0.04435914355194638,0.25010576284920244,0.3236888846266518,0.22539180409620835,0.2593461054825909,0.2566611226537928,0.4681274894319318,0.7154002370154379,0.32262208514351537,0.13542005530657306,,,0.35349485307599404,0.1311748453339058,-0.4827201555509601,0,-1.8226948563157084
53,yes_115.txt,"Tribune analysis: More Illinois schools reach key measles vaccine threshold
Schools across Illinois appear to be improving their measles vaccine rates, according to a Tribune analysis of Illinois State Board of Education data.
Measles cases in Illinois are rising, now nine according to the Illinois Department of Public Health. But a greater percentage of schools are reaching the threshold of 90 to 95 percent MMR vaccination rate among students. That rate of vaccination is required to achieve herd immunity, health officials say, and protects those who are either too young or too ill to get vaccines.
All but 2.8 percent of Illinois schools met the 90 percent threshold in 2013-14 an improvement over the 2008-09 school year, when 5.1 percent of schools had less than 90 percent of students immunized for measles, according to the analysis of nearly 4,900 schools, ranging from small private institutions to large suburban high schools.
When the rate hit 95 percent, the news also was encouraging. In 2008-09, 11.5 percent of schools fell below the 95 percent threshold, but during the 2013-14 school year, students at all but 9.2 percent of schools fell below that threshold, the Tribune found.
""Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in humans,"" said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases. ""Delaying vaccination leaves children vulnerable to measles when it is most dangerous to their development and also affects the entire community.""
At first, measles symptoms can appear to be benign like a case of the sniffles runny nose, cough, fever, followed by the trademark rash. But as many as 1 in 20 children with measles will develop pneumonia and 1 in 1,000 will get encephalitis, a swelling of the brain that can lead to convulsions and brain damage, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Parents of unvaccinated children should ""avoid anywhere that a child is sick,"" said Dr. Rachel Rubin, a senior medical health officer with the Cook County Department of Health, last week. If you are bringing your child to an emergency room or doctor's office, parents should call ahead so providers can take necessary precautions, she said.
Parents started fearing the vaccine shots after a 1998 study, published in a prestigious British medical journal, which purported to show a connection between the MMR and autism. The findings were debunked, but the anti-vaccine movement was born.
""I have never paid attention to this before,"" said Judy Sitrick, pushing her 18-month-old son at the Wal-Mart in Country Club Hills. ""I would definitely ask about this before I enroll him in any pre-school. I just assumed everybody does the right thing.""",10,19,27.473684210526315,0,0.6204764974407024,0.38902944783892546,0.341453546192497,0.3369625230009357,0.21052631578947367,0.4118001270884027,0.3568223817854071,0.3083525005158865,0.3386345983474027,0.20245164242805913,0.19254303832861538,0.15769325987849797,0.19569272124430254,0.11617448352683897,0.9833066711181451,0.19816592599110996,0.14394084955638314,1.2269903610044202,0.24524768181103856,0.15649056985812812,1.3407690689641003,0.2676160968439807,0.15923617053755376,1.3474794367601375,0.26997379559123896,0.027083333333333334,0.04023809523809524,0.0625,0.03741496598639456,3.223681702280327,3.5987888815169895,0,0,1.1168346729112544,6.756728960591627,9.231420117578892,-0.6131884334026445,-0.6076407178947341,1.0012468800368943,,-0.08697546458692369,-0.23236976080740276,0.9900332104867915,0.9951987882636271,0.051547181775333996,0.7597735800239745,-0.21112678099507112,0.6565505355699338,0.6453045213871484,-0.6052711034839768,-0.19112906892001572,0.4351428921118152,0.5861156649945354,0.49570883448336256,0.5467244285893811,0.5460351030640954,0.7851871069144853,0.8666819536091934,0.8411288361158996,-0.10191940454691359,0.11442635403343836,0.027455647603899635,0.18849631644895953,0.2541632191096369,0.2552496725266994,-0.09133789866208873,0.28044944288972745,0.7693809059047526,0.015585790462667488,1.029111161914221,0.5846890151324976,,,-0.6327763075485279,0.6200284249001056,-0.2730357893233254,0,0.41361864704628293
54,yes_116.txt,"Will Vaccination Become Partisan?
According to a recently released survey from the Pew Research Center, the public opinion on vaccine requirements, for example, divides much more by age than by political affiliation. This may be a function of the fact that younger people are less likely to have seen the diseases the vaccines are designed to protect against. (In other words, vaccines are victims of their own success.) However, the poll was worrying in one political respect: In 2009, there was no partisan difference in attitudes toward these requirements. The latest study did find some small differences along party lines. According to Brendan Nyhan, a Dartmouth political science professor who has done research on effective communication around vaccines, injecting partisan politics into individual decisions about whether to vaccinate could have unintended consequences. He argued in the New York Times recently that making the decision to vaccinate one of partisan allegiance could potentially push some individuals who might otherwise have vaccinated their children to forgo the process.
Seth Masket warns that if enough Republican leaders or conservative cultural figures publicly question the importance of immunizations, and if such messages go unchallenged or even embraced by commentators on Fox and other conservative media outlets, that message could soon be adopted by conservative parents with only modest attachments to politics:
And in some ways, this argument meshes very well with the American conservative world view. The idea that I can make better judgments about my kids than the government can, that I should be concerned about me and my own rather than the larger social network, that I shouldnt have to make sacrifices or face risks on behalf of strangers it wouldnt take much to fold that into the definition of modern conservatism. Resistance to vaccinations doesnt have to mean embracing organic food or breastfeeding toddlers; thats simply a liberal interpretation of it.
But were not quite there yet. The main cultural elites advocating avoiding or at least questioning vaccinations, from doctors with celebrity pretensions to celebrities with medical pretensions, are mostly on the left right now. Chris Christie has limited appeal, and Rand Paul has not quite yet demonstrated an ability to reach those outside his libertarian circles. But if were going to see the anti-vaxxer belief system mutate and spread to the right, this will be how it happens.",5,16,26.9375,0,0.5337411512931188,0.4282675840581457,0.21955276280641556,0.23843218485514323,0.0,0.37189995691828104,0.33791443879643296,0.25731545687474383,0.28256761604445235,0.19553625891390053,0.18756796851294127,0.14812484585087407,0.14343488935435023,0.13040560419680686,1.0928654838144443,0.21950681238696287,0.12167933598442901,1.0267745421849215,0.2082638151146874,0.15147392255674155,1.3033543311034919,0.2623377585733552,0.15320757050371567,1.3045617274676216,0.2606312410236243,0.011363636363636364,0.041176470588235294,0.023255813953488372,0.0306553911205074,2.9962692312685313,3.449400555928818,0,0,1.1312884144279494,6.2572181878660285,9.106813510409916,-1.1182635009871913,-0.7372489417346946,0.8947972942332696,,-0.8245539903476342,0.07899614754013984,-0.11356643331740662,0.0877537100641744,-0.7823310051255915,-0.28474455983522073,-0.8199598519081345,0.17410490954216026,-0.24995575577559062,-0.8300338890603648,-0.44382858938287223,0.2720944049714919,-0.748518842070985,0.8368110461917714,0.8682038740711453,0.8558138829449228,-0.14328221565176003,-0.15535345731982805,-0.09337696178132536,-0.6333851053096862,-0.6362643556575304,-0.4247027814477396,-0.6372824317161881,-0.6993308944641851,-0.7335065332084345,-0.6130982223703062,0.31197017350661227,-0.4286268665801859,-0.35549511147791346,-2.194923974499721,-1.8698148760849835,,,-0.33567440748568833,-1.0009655143693792,-0.7093955054508851,0,4.322128600218157
55,yes_117.txt,"Column: How to eradicate anti-vaccine outbreaks
The anti-vaccination movement has hit a wall. After years of flourishing on the margins of the political spectrum, activists and their political enablers are on the defensive, as long-dormant diseases come back with a vengeance.
This description fits the intensifying uproar over the re-emergence of measles and whooping cough in 2015. It applies just as well to an outbreak of smallpox in 1894. Then, as now, a small, vocal group of anti-vaccination activists wedded junk science, bogus statistics and appeals to emotion to try to undermine a previous vaccination campaign.
The 19th-century predecessors of todays anti-vaxxers also acted out of a genuine conviction that vaccines posed huge health risks. And then, too, beliefs, no matter how heartfelt, werent a sensible substitute for an objective evaluation of risk. Its a lesson likely to be hammered home in the coming years, as diseases make a comeback in the U.S., empowered in some cases by the rising refusal of parents to vaccinate their children.
The concept of vaccination, which essentially involves using prophylactic exposure to a disease to trick the body into developing immunity, was controversial from its beginnings.
In the 18th century, doctors in Britain began taking the pus from a smallpox sore on a patient with a mild case of the disease and rubbing it into the open wound of a healthy patient.
The patient would get sick but recover, thus acquiring immunity to the disease.
This risky method, known as variolation, became unnecessary after the 1790s, when Edward Jenner showed that comparable levels of immunity could be achieved by dosing patients with cowpox, a close relative of smallpox. Private manufacturers in England and the U.S. soon began making small quantities of the vaccine from the lymph of infected cows.
Smallpox, which was arguably the most terrifying, gruesome disease in human history, led many skeptics to try vaccination. That willingness, combined with the growing availability of vaccines and laws making vaccination compulsory, particularly for children, made smallpox a distant, unpleasant memory for most Americans by the 1850s.
But as in our own time, fading memories of a terrifying disease gave rise to a false sense of security.
The parallels are eerie. Many of these earlier anti-vaxxers were affluent and well-educated and fond of progressive causes. As the historian Michael Willrich has observed, they tended to throw themselves into other maligned causes of their era, including anti-imperialism, womens rights, antivivisection, vegetarianism.
These skeptics found a leader: William Tebb, a British reformer, activist and gadfly who was well known for leading a high-profile fight against compulsory vaccination laws in Britain. He arrived in New York City in 1879 and helped spur the formation of the Anti-Vaccination Society of America, which soon became a formidable political force, along with other similar societies.
The early anti-vaxxers deployed a wide range of arguments to press their case. Tebb claimed, all evidence to the contrary, that 80 percent of smallpox cases affected people who had been vaccinated. He also alleged, facts notwithstanding, that 25,000 children were slaughtered each year in Britain as a consequence of compulsory vaccination programs.
The anti-vaxxers arguments resonated because they tapped into understandable anxieties. The rise of so-called vaccine farms, where unregulated producers harvested lymphatic fluid from resident cows, did little to allay peoples fears.
Indeed, while companies such as the New England Vaccine Company claimed to produce vaccines entirely free from any trace of pus, debris, or epidermis, lab tests showed otherwise.
Immunization rates declined. In 1886, the Medical News worried that the trend portends evil in the near future a smallpox epidemic. These predictions came true between 1898 and 1904, when smallpox waxed and waned in the nations big cities, with New York among the hardest hit.
Now, the anti-vaccination movement is back, even getting a suggestion of support from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.
If history is any guide, it wont last. There is nothing like the return of an ancient killer to focus attention on the real costs and benefits of vaccination. We should be thankful, perhaps, that we are only facing whooping cough and measles. Smallpox would have been far worse.

To be more concise, Ontario and New Brunswick provinces require that children be immunized for diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, and rubella. Manitoba Province only requires that children be immunized for measles. But even with these laws in place, there are exemptions allowed. They include medical and religious grounds as well as matters of conscience. And, to be sure that citizens understand the regulations fully, Health Canadas Immunization Statement also says that these regulations covering the three provinces do not imply compulsory immunization.
Torontos Public health officials are now getting worried because, on Jan. 2, four cases of measles were confirmed, two in children under the age of 2-years, and in two adults from different families. Health officials are saying no source case has been identified and there were no links between the four cases.
There is fear that the measles outbreak in the United States could spread, especially after the latest warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Director Tom Frieden was on CBSs Face the Nation on Sunday. He emphasized, We are very concerned by the growing number of people who are susceptible to measles, and the possibility that we could have a large outbreak in this country as a result.
Herd Immunity protects everyone
Toronto Health officials are saying a 95 percent immunization rate is needed to provide a protective herd immunity in the population. We know that vaccines are very safe, and well over 95 percent of parents [in Canada] get their children vaccinated with benefit and little harm, Dr. Vinita Dubey told CBC Radios Matt Galloway on Metro Morning.
Global News did a survey of Toronto schools last year using 2012 rates of immunization for the MMR vaccine. Surprisingly, to many health officials, the results were not what they expected. Global News found a wide disparity in the immunization rates at many of the schools, with one school having an MMR vaccination rate of only 43.75 percent. Many more schools were far below the 95 percent herd immunity rate, a level where enough people are immunized to protect everyone.
During the 2011-12 school year, just over 3,000 students were suspended from school until they either provided proof of immunization, were vaccinated or filed an exemption. Less than 2.0 percent returned with an exemption. The Public Health Agency of Canada says that the MMR uptake for Canada is at 95 percent compliance with immunizations in children. But UNICEF put Canada near the bottom of the list of industrialized nations in 2013 with a compliance rate of only 84 percent.
So just how troubling are the questionable loopholes in the Health Canada Immunization Statement? It apparently isnt as bad as some may think. Dr. John Spika, director general of the public health agencys center for immunization and respiratory infectious diseases does say the herd immunity rate for measles should be 95 percent, but he doesnt think there is an anti-vaccine movement in Canada. Citing Torontos vaccination rates, Spika said, Thats troubling to me if you were telling me it was for all of Toronto.
With each province making their own regulations regarding vaccinations, there is a patchwork of policies, all of them just a little bit different from each other. Depending on which provinces health official you ask about MMR vaccination rates, you will get answers varying from 80 percent to 90 percent or above.

57,yes_119.txt,"Opting out of vaccination is recipe for outbreak
Parents who dont vaccinate their children due to concerns about side effects can put others at risk -- even those who have been vaccinated. Gwen Ifill talks to Patsy Stinchfield of the Childrens Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota about the importance and safety of immunization.
Read the Full Transcript
GWEN IFILL:
President Obama echoed the concerns of health officials yesterday when he said in an interview that children should be vaccinated.
Joining me now is Patricia Stinchfield. She's the director of infection prevention and control for the Children's Hospital and Clinics of Minnesota.
Welcome. Thank you for joining us.
How does this outbreak compare to what we have seen in the past? Or should we be really worried by these numbers?
PATRICIA STINCHFIELD, Children's Hospital and Clinics of Minnesota: I think we should be concerned by these numbers because the spread of measles is so easy to happen amongst people who are un-immunized.
That virus can stay aloft in the air for two hours after someone with measles has walked through a room, whether it's a lobby in a clinic, or a grocery store or a football game. And anyone who comes through that room who is not immunized will get measles; 90 percent of un-immunized will get measles. It's very contagious.
I spent my 27-year career at Children's ever since the 1990s measles outbreak trying to explain to people how dangerous measles is. You had an entire ward filled with measles kids, and two of them died. And ever since then, I have tried to commit myself and Children's in Minnesota has as well to the message that measles is dangerous, measles kills.
It gets in the lungs, it gets in the brain. It is not just a virus. The vaccine is safe, it's effective, it works, and it should be used by parents to help protect their children.
GWEN IFILL:
Is there any other reason to explain the sudden return of measles, other than the fact that people decided that vaccinations are not safe?
PATRICIA STINCHFIELD:
Well, we're a global society. And we do know that measles cases in the United States do have an international link, oftentimes.
But we also know that, in the last few years, we have seen a dramatic increase in many communities of people opting out of vaccines. This is a recipe for an outbreak. If you have a vulnerable community and you have an introduction of the measles virus, you will have disease.
And we're seeing that come out of California and spread very quickly through the United States. I think the good news here is that if we didn't have 90 percent of parents following the usual immunization schedule, we wouldn't be talking about 100 cases. We would be talking about thousands and thousands of cases.
GWEN IFILL:
But that is the number that confounds me. If 92, 95 percent of people are getting the vaccination, how much is this how dangerous is this, except for a small subset who are not?
PATRICIA STINCHFIELD:
Well, we always have vulnerable populations.
So, you can only get the vaccine when you're 12 months of age and older. That's your first dose. So, lots of babies are under 1 year of age, and that special vulnerable valley is from six months to 12 months, where mom's antibodies have dropped off, they're not old enough yet to get the vaccine. So babies six months to 12 months are especially vulnerable.
Pregnant women can have severe miscarriages if they get measles. And then of course immune-deficient or those people getting chemotherapy or cancer are very highly at risk for a severe measles case.
GWEN IFILL:
How does this outbreak compare to other ones we have discussed certainly on this program before involving the flu or Ebola?
PATRICIA STINCHFIELD:
Well, they're Ebola, flu and measles are all viruses. They're all contagious.
But there is nothing as contagious as measles. It's highly contagious. I would say influenza is next, HIV below that, and Ebola is the lowest in terms of viral contagion. It's very difficult to get Ebola. It's very easy to get measles. Both can take people's lives, however.
There's a vaccine for measles, measles-mumps-rubella. There is not a vaccine for Ebola. And at this point in time, there's no reason for parents not to vaccinate their children and protect them against measles.
GWEN IFILL:
Are there other diseases where people where vaccines or choosing not to have a vaccine has shown that that disease is back or is on the rise?
PATRICIA STINCHFIELD:
We are definitely seeing more whooping cough than we have. There's been spread of whooping cough, or pertussis, throughout the country in the last few years. That vaccine is not quite as effective as measles vaccine, but also the spread is going through communities of those who are opting out of vaccines.
We are seeing an increase in that as well.
GWEN IFILL:
And finally and briefly, what are the symptoms that we should be on the lookout for when it comes to measles?
PATRICIA STINCHFIELD:
Measles as fever, rash and the three C's. The C's are cough, conjunctivitis, or pinkeye, and then coryza, or runny nose.
But the rash looks like a bucket of rash that is poured over the head and goes down onto the trunk, and then clears that way. It's a very distinct rash, but only for those of us who have seen it. So, get in and get checked if that's the rash you're seeing.
GWEN IFILL:
Dr. Patricia Stinchfield at Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, thank you very much.
PATRICIA STINCHFIELD:

58,yes_120.txt,"Our View: Vaccines benefit everyone, save lives
News of dangerous diseases diagnosed in Jackson County has health officials concerned, and for good reason. It should concern parents, too, but too many still resist vaccinating their children.
The Jackson County Public Health Division has been notified of four confirmed cases of whooping cough, also known as pertussis, and 15 cases of chicken pox since Thanksgiving. Not surprisingly, the diseases are more prevalent at schools with low immunization rates.
Parents are understandably cautious about subjecting their children to vaccines, and there is some real risk, although it is extremely small. Too many parents, however, fall prey to false and misleading claims about vaccine safety.
No medical procedure, medication or vaccine is entirely without risk. Neither is driving to work in the morning or putting your child on a school bus, but we do these things anyway.
Parents who refuse to vaccinate may think only their children are at risk, but that is far from the case. In the most recent outbreaks, those at risk include very young infants, pregnant women, the sick and the elderly.
Whooping cough can be a serious illness for anyone who contracts it, with a violent cough that can linger for weeks. It can potentially kill infants too young to be vaccinated.
Chicken pox, once a rite of passage for many children, is now preventable with a vaccine. Again, most cases are not life-threatening. But an unvaccinated pregnant woman who may have school-age children at home can suffer complications including pneumonia, and the disease can cause serious birth defects or life-threatening infections in her unborn child.
In addition to these vulnerable populations, some individuals with chronic health conditions cannot be vaccinated, and are therefore at risk when otherwise healthy people go unvaccinated.
Parents have the responsibility and the right to make medical decisions for their children. But they should consider their children's relatives, neighbors and classmates as well. When vaccination rates drop, it makes disease outbreaks more likely, and puts far more people at risk than just those unvaccinated children.",10,20,19.85,0,0.570966113554804,0.4604777006726516,0.33650246784091,0.3614234705766042,0.15,0.3851201959292997,0.35298849241193814,0.2696572199858951,0.424705989540865,0.22799263567183958,0.19143337335889088,0.15507034284316681,0.2337531833195438,0.10984572312848603,0.872222990812339,0.1794068017639914,0.15601588449942028,1.3197557542808354,0.26256976028222095,0.1644435357853861,1.3381581197997108,0.27012024976147897,0.16366807310856424,1.3434486547514595,0.27144691226412576,0.03787878787878788,0.030000000000000002,0.030303030303030304,0.026737967914438502,3.174192120663532,3.576768563300317,0,0,1.204994796869797,6.914003286190637,9.340201831584515,-0.6131884334026445,-0.5644379766147471,-0.5122964332053199,,-0.5080010046737916,0.3345926968161801,0.945209804488221,1.2204793150876696,-0.18819279695868207,0.06133866240185048,-0.33457747270443455,0.29076977109471996,2.019665943574601,0.22485853084596658,-0.24749246001060235,0.39044764237965796,1.5581576384818117,0.3440163417194987,0.22077054986511477,0.273732514178241,1.288805132584125,1.3402185472523125,1.2788219225596626,0.7406211122050557,0.06204017165565957,0.241968964338888,0.7955644477791028,0.16461214609736038,0.41115491680943084,0.2669794320772895,-0.06345584190046427,-0.21349640238535966,-0.570550194886657,0.32749550596940946,0.22288727101448624,,,1.179387021068109,1.130409266553622,0.10790675394801791,0,0.9586740076953202
59,yes_122.txt,"What the anti-vaxxers are getting dangerously wrong
Despite being declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, a recent Disneyland-centered measles outbreak has since spread to 14 states and may be responsible for an estimated 102 reported cases. This alarming resurgence has once again brought the safety and effectiveness of vaccines to the forefront of national debate. The outbreak, and the subsequent national response, has incited inflammatory remarks and frustration among politicians, journalists, parents, medical professionals and philanthropists nationwide.
One thing is certainthe distortion of the facts about vaccines could have dangerous consequences for public safety and public health. In this post, well cover some basic facts about vaccines, their significance, their contentious history and their recent misrepresentation by the anti-vaccine movement.
1. What are vaccines?
Vaccines are a type of drug that aid the bodys immune system. They essentially act as a neutered and ineffective form of a disease, tricking the body into producing the types of cells required to defeat the infection even though the vaccine cells pose no harm themselves. By doing so, vaccines teach the immune system how to defeat imposter cells and attack true infections when they occur.
Vaccines are critical for two reasons. 1) They help each vaccinated individual resist infections, sparing lives and reducing sicknesses in those who receive them. 2) They can stop the spread of disease within the larger community as a whole.
2. What is herd immunity?
Measles is a highly transmissible disease; so transmissible in fact, that 90 to 95 percent of people must be vaccinated in order to protect the entire population, or achieve what is called herd immunity. This effect is what helps eliminate disease entirely.
When enough people have a vaccine and cannot catch or spread a disease, the pathogen cannot form a functional chain of infection. This means that even if someone cannot receive a vaccine, say a newborn or a child undergoing chemotherapy, they are protected because everyone they come into contact with is immunized. This enables us to defeat strains of disease entirely by denying the strain the chance to spread to new victims. (The Washington Post provides a more exhaustive explanation of this concept here).
While most unvaccinated children have been protected from diseases by the herd immunity of their communities, the most recent outbreak of measles in a California county with a particularly high rate of unvaccinated children shows the potential harm of an anti-vaccine movement.
3. Do we know vaccines work?
Yes, very much so. Vaccines have successfully eliminated some of the most prevalent and harmful diseases in our history, from polio to smallpox. They are 90-99% effective on average, and save 2.5 million children in the U.S. from potential diseases every year. Moreover, they have been proven safe in an enormous number of studies and are encouraged by the American Academy of Pediatrics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health, National Academy of Sciences, and the World Health Organization. 
4. If vaccines are known to be safe and effective, why all the debate?
Much of the anti-vaccine debate surrounds the link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) and autism. A 1998 study in the Lancet by Dr. Andrew Wakefield concluded that the MMR could be linked to autism, inciting panic among parents and the medical community. The study has since been declared an elaborate fraud, the paper was retracted, and Wakefield lost his medical license. Indeed, an exhaustive study of more than 500,000 vaccinated children published in the New England Journal of Medicine found no such evidence of a connection, and additional studies continue to show similar results.
However, even the slight possibility of a link failed to calm parents, and the issue drew even more attention in the late 2000s when celebrity parents of autistic children, such as Jenny McCarthy and Holly Robinson Peete, became particularly outspoken about the alleged link between autism and vaccines (McCarthy has since indicated she is ""pro-vaccine"").
5. Why is the debate getting so politicized?
Americans as a whole embrace the scientific consensus of the benefits and safety of vaccines. However, since the California outbreak, many public figures, several of them potential 2016 presidential candidates, have made controversial statements doubting the health benefits of vaccines.
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie spoke of the government needing to balance the desires of parents with the public health benefits of vaccines despite searching for no such balance when, against the advice of public health officials, he forcibly quarantined a symptom-free nurse who had treated Ebola patients this summer. Sen. Rand Paul told CNBC that he had heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines, before admitting that there is no evidence linking mental disorders to vaccines and getting a hepatitis booster vaccine himself.
Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, tweeted that The science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork.
President Obama remarked on the Today show, The science is, you know, pretty indisputable. Weve looked at this again and again. There is every reason to get vaccinated, but there arent reasons to not to.
This politicization of the debate is a dangerous development of a clear-cut public health issue. In recent days we have seen calls for the President to mandate inoculations for all children a move that some worry would risk pushing those who dislike the President to needlessly embrace the anti-vaccine movement.
After watching the panicked and politically charged national response to the Ebola crisis this summer, in which governors such as Christie and Andrew Cuomo ignored the recommendations of public health officials to impose unnecessary quarantines and impose travel restrictions, it was ironic to remember that the GOP has a long track record of undermining the funding for our public health infrastructure before criticizing the government for a lack of preparation when a pandemic gets in the news. Our public health system has suffered from the polarization of health policy; the anti-vaccine movement might only get stronger with increased political attention heading into 2016. With an issue as important as vaccination, we cannot afford to introduce political warfare.
The vast majority of Americans join scientists and doctors in their appreciation for the benefits and necessity of vaccines. Politicizing what is factually a very one-sided debate may well lead to more misinformation and greater rates of vaccine avoidance. When inoculation rates fall so much that diseases previously eradicated return, it doesnt just effect those who resist vaccines it affects everyone.",23,54,23.037037037037038,0,0.6448924727035019,0.41561733556024283,0.42553355058898096,0.41657905723305716,0.07407407407407407,0.42598102313720365,0.3673196818369843,0.2962045542890152,0.28016601670484903,0.2015483723812257,0.17389393743173417,0.14802821811225655,0.13503911380238828,0.11202139449260831,0.951239645586235,0.19011368712528826,0.10720933450962578,0.9260742550924378,0.18379425106093572,0.155341066510373,1.3316683166925263,0.2640200988207167,0.15632783013101342,1.338794685457804,0.2667658254904714,0.0048961840628507294,0.005328246632594459,0.023076923076923078,0.019260129183793304,3.0740550580787622,3.505257315602454,0,0,1.1102960508059192,6.3327652547009405,9.392869096061977,0.7000067423171773,0.9044552269048057,0.12043158428029321,,0.12065268056053569,-0.021387216551508045,1.751231459796893,1.7284514441647376,-0.48892942084563623,1.1310051587183927,0.12688478538338116,0.5417177963622476,-0.2883037531546823,-0.6346290547007576,-1.1383758470170906,0.270447840916896,-0.9629420464018162,0.39616447056074156,0.4526298566189396,0.4291508891240429,-0.7467880115815109,-0.6693950545625623,-0.7116722219279479,-0.2236982671101591,-0.0681714823304619,-0.28058842492560876,-0.20987904212031602,0.061215846541649035,-0.08426135970659004,-0.8277626661271007,-0.892198510411676,-0.4340878706712853,-0.9810616835215034,-1.092151388478322,-0.9520682353756343,,,-0.767180056850679,-0.7558029590139373,0.29234217915332084,0,5.4313752613907695
60,yes_125.txt,"Letter: Wrong-headed opinions on vaccines harm kids
It is frustrating hearing uneducated opinions from politicians about health issues as important as childhood vaccinations. Their statements have a huge impact on what voters do. What politicians say affects parents choices. Parents go into their doctors office and have a confused idea about what to do for their children because they hear mixed messages from government officials. This can lead parents to not vaccinate their children.
Science does not lie. Vaccinations save childrens lives. As a RN who sees how much preventative medicine, such as vaccines, impacts lives and health, I am pro-vaccination. All children who are medically able to receive vaccinations should get them.
According to Weinberg and Szilagyi (2010), More than a dozen major infectious diseases (most notably, smallpox, poliomyelitis, rabies, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b disease, measles, mumps, and rubella) have been controlled in many parts of the world since vaccines were developed. This is not coincidence.
Parents should not have the right to choose whether they want to protect their children in the best, evidence-based ways.
My generation has never had to deal much with preventable, communicable diseases. We have never witnessed loved ones fall ill to polio, be placed in an iron lung to be able to breathe, or die from polio. We have not had to live in fear of going out in public because we could catch smallpox. We have not had to deal with these situations because brilliant people and scientists in the past 200 years have figured out how to stop the spread of disease through vaccination.
From Edward Jenners use of cowpox to stop the spread of smallpox in 1796 to Jonas Salk helping to form a polio vaccine in the 1950s, vaccines have been proved to greatly reduce the incidence of disease and improve the lives of millions of people.
I live in a generation that takes this for granted. My generation thinks that science is lying or forcing them to do something against their will. They do not want to be forced to do anything, including protecting children in one of the simplest ways possible vaccination.
Politicians do not have the right to discredit hundreds of years of science and research because they are trying to win an election or appease both sides of the aisle. A prime example is recent comments made by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Christie stated that he thinks parents should have a choice on whether to vaccinate their children, but he himself chose to vaccinate his four children.
Christies state has some of the most strict vaccination regulations in the country, including mandatory influenza vaccinations for children 6 months to 5 years when they will be attending day care and preschool. New Jersey is one of 30 states that do not allow parents to opt out of vaccinations due to philosophical or moral beliefs. Medical and religious exemptions are allowed, but only a simple form signed by parents stating one of these reasons is necessary.
What kind of message is Christie sending? He is not supporting his own Department of Healths recommendations for vaccination. He is not supporting medical professionals and specialists that his state has in place to protect the publics health.
This is happening in states across the country. We are setting ourselves up for a wake-up call. We need to protect children. We need to vaccinate our children.",12,34,18.794117647058822,0,0.5699586900459095,0.3659301317444672,0.31084941011956996,0.3007309263261656,0.20588235294117646,0.4088430543635766,0.37769932927636435,0.3625681823516196,0.36403992674191415,0.25786462813228755,0.20461092474416043,0.21032534219255603,0.23147817158052103,0.14526465647239878,1.194969917193004,0.24094819486943825,0.15353703921725942,1.2851586423493835,0.2565144567665213,0.16415601311084682,1.3949347681696103,0.27671732937367716,0.16541564607394707,1.3939258174895444,0.2776867613872896,0.05486111111111111,0.040824915824915826,0.05194805194805195,0.024975024975024976,3.1146388617381358,3.5480618225377247,0,0,1.1452853291301952,6.658893768312504,9.098950201421543,-0.4111584063688258,0.04040040130506874,-0.7219225969776842,,-0.516567915160812,-0.41566948477428534,0.7129659699749157,0.6615128931723213,0.033152810005460644,0.6823624790488557,0.46110795440804736,1.1690433583845676,1.0509689678341592,1.195753669543716,0.4218370246613758,1.3320084929916691,1.5000551673101605,1.1929639952558106,1.1678098648257156,1.1670514379918442,1.185418999721444,1.1636117550502612,1.1258169301420615,0.7101608405278014,1.2012089830867307,0.8070947673554185,1.0349415183396022,1.2860531161321882,1.0715406280972166,0.8306482155211067,0.30016118578115497,0.447261451927321,-0.6673306091888649,-0.516793280873228,-0.24877479915422324,,,-0.04796274831069939,0.30253726676878084,-0.7369320170046966,0,6.1354336060634145
61,yes_126.txt,"Cleaveland: Measles should not be ignored
I contracted measles along with several of my second-grade classmates. I recall two weeks in a darkened room and a persistent earache along with my rash. One classmate almost died from measles-related pneumonia. Very few of us escaped measles, chicken pox, mumps and rubella in those pre-vaccine years.
Now the disease, which for decades has been easily prevented with a vaccination, is back in the news with 155 cases in 16 states since December, predominantly in children and young adults who had not been vaccinated. Several infants, too young to be vaccinated, also contracted the disease.
While measles isn't as deadly and frightening as Ebola, the last disease outbreak that hit the news, it's still a serious illness. Worldwide measles remains a problem with an estimated 20 million cases and 145,000 fatalities yearly.
Measles is a highly contagious, viral illness acquired by inhaling airborne virus shed by an infected person. The virus can remain suspended in air for hours.
Prior to the introduction of a vaccine in 1963, measles infected as many as 4 million American children yearly. Pneumonia was a serious complication. An average of 4,000 children each year suffered measles encephalitis, which might result in permanent neurological deficits. Between 400 and 500 children died annually from complications of measles.
The measles vaccine is based upon weakened viral particles. Initially a single injection was recommended at age 12 to 15 months. Because of concern that a single injection might be inadequate, a booster injection between 4 and 6 years has been advised for the past 25 years. Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella are administered together (MMR).
Widespread vaccination programs steadily reduced the incidence of these diseases. Children with certain immune deficiency disorders or who receive chemotherapy for cancer should not receive the vaccine. Pregnant women and anyone allergic to components of the vaccine should not be injected.
In 2000, measles was declared no longer endemic in the U.S.; there were no longer any reservoirs of the disease within our nation. Ninety percent of eligible American children had been vaccinated. The hundred or so cases that were diagnosed each year were attributed to infected travelers who contracted the disease abroad.
In 1998, a highly publicized study in the medical journal Lancet suggested that the measles vaccine might be associated with a persistent intestinal infection which, in turn, led to autism in nine of 12 children who were evaluated. Lawsuits proliferated; an anti-vaccination movement gained traction. The potential costs of litigation threatened the manufacture of vaccines.
Despite multiple efforts, no other researchers could replicate the claims made in the 1998 publication. In February 2010, the Lancet retracted the earlier article, charging scientific misconduct, dishonesty and violation of research and clinical ethics by the principal author. By that time, 10 of the 13 coauthors of the paper had disassociated themselves from the research.
All U.S. states require vaccinations for measles and other common childhood illnesses for entry into public schools. Religious and personal exemptions are granted to varying degrees among the states. Some private schools do not mandate vaccinations. Because of parental concerns of vaccine safety, some school districts in Western states have seen vaccination rates slip into the 80 percent range. To achieve group immunity, at least 90 percent of eligible children need to be vaccinated.
Concerns over recommended vaccinations boil down to a tension between parental or personal choice and public good. An unvaccinated person places at risk infants and other children who haven't been vaccinated because they're too young, have immune system issues or cancer or other reasons for not receiving it. Recent, ill-informed comments by nationally prominent politicians have muddied public discussion of vaccine policy. Careful science should prevail over politics.
To inform choice, I recommend consulting the Centers for Disease Control website (www.cdu.gov/measles) for a thorough discussion of all aspects of measles, a serious, potentially dangerous yet preventable illness.

Our opinion: A completely avoidable measles outbreak highlights the danger of easily obtained vaccination exemptions.
Well say what too many politicians worried about every single vote will not: The measles outbreak in 14 states is rooted in illogical, misinformed, scientifically baseless fears, held by a growing number of parents who are opting their children out of vaccines.
Science simply does not support the belief that vaccines cause such problems as autism.
What science does support is this: Vaccines are effective. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, polio has been eliminated from the United States thanks to widespread polio vaccination; smallpox was eradicated in the 1970s due to the vaccine and the way it was given; and measles declined rapidly after an early 1990s resurgence due primarily to intensive efforts to vaccinate preschool-aged children. The CDC notes a record low of measles cases nationally in 2004, with just 37 cases reported.
Fast-forward a decade, and 102 people across 14 states in January alone had measles, mostly in an outbreak connected to Disneyland in California. It happens that California allows an easily-obtained personal belief exemption from vaccines and, in the county surrounding the amusement park, there is an affluent pocket of parents seeking such exemptions at a higher rate than the statewide average.
The outbreak has sparked a national debate fueled by those who liken vaccines and their producers to the tobacco industry, and suggest vaccination should be a personal choice.
To characterize this as an issue of freedom is at best a misjudgment, at worst a cynical pandering for votes by invoking our fundamental values. It is about health, and our shared responsibility as citizens.
Some personal choices must be weighed against their societal consequences: drinking and driving, second-hand smoke, vaccinations. The refusal to use vaccines affects more than an individual. Epidemiologists say 95 percent of children must be immunized to maintain herd immunity, which is defined as most members of a community being protected from a contagious disease because a critical portion of that community is immunized.
In New York, its not easy for parents to exempt their children from vaccines. Medical and religious exemptions are allowed, but both require supporting documentation, and school officials can bar unvaccinated students from attendance. Yet some state lawmakers want to make it easier by adding a philosophical exemption, which is available in 19 states. Thats entirely the wrong direction. The consequences of this legislation could be tragic.
Whats apparent is an epidemic of misinformation. In a national Harris Poll in 2013, 76 percent of respondents said vaccines and their potential risks need more research. Clearly, public awareness must be raised. Vaccines are effective. They save lives and reduce suffering.

But by 2000, the U.S. had achieved a remarkable public health feat: Measles was declared eliminated from this country.
This didnt mean there werent occasional cases of measles. The disease is active in other countries and can be brought into the U.S. But it was ostensibly eliminated. Unfortunately, the anti-vaccine movement is doing its best to bring measles back. In 2014, there were 644 reported cases of measles and 23 outbreaks, per the CDC. Thats easily the highest number of measles cases in the U.S. since 2000, and it was fueled, in part, by the anti-vaccine movement.
This is particularly frustrating since the benefits of vaccinations far outweigh the costs, and much of the anti-vaccine movement is motivated by the misguided belief that the measles vaccination is linked to autism.
This is not true. This misinformation is based on a now-debunked 1998 study that linked autism to the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine. That study has been declared a fraud. The Institute of Medicine has scientifically studied the issue and said there is no link.
The benefits of the MMR vaccine far outweigh the risks. Its an incredibly safe vaccine and serious side effects are rare. Whereas between 2001 and 2013, about 28 percent of children younger than 5 with measles had to be taken to a hospital. Measles can lead to death, brain damage and deafness.
And, of course, through the miracle of modern medicine, its all avoidable.",8,21,17.904761904761905,0,0.6633455500006675,0.4951037640372912,0.3583596224586169,0.3355758587519328,0.09523809523809523,0.3902285950707978,0.4044061742648054,0.2313443125727085,0.30720586346218454,0.2004950469167068,0.19668552560796,0.16517248249843589,0.16514884734504104,0.15097088949799564,1.083612303711959,0.22873812512828234,0.15134659004204726,1.0784185400468316,0.22869274862405173,0.18417657932612047,1.3990770485696842,0.2883978523235525,0.16024879455415889,1.3452745339084087,0.2697384650852712,0.1346153846153846,0.08928571428571427,0.07142857142857142,0.03201970443349754,3.07781944193215,3.5067073117825647,0,0,1.0627145581691035,6.96595531292501,9.854486444139972,-0.8152184604364633,-0.5212352353347603,-0.8984879425081933,,0.277573637853228,0.6093604791541569,1.143088336361781,0.9824278826567577,-0.405100396765649,0.19506780556554418,1.3210645587934895,-0.07139647685382819,0.14346017827303625,-0.6688640852003803,0.019280953008897636,0.5625909654963854,-0.1939570362851021,1.3297352833850853,0.8410521814315411,0.98981322789528,1.0940611118019434,0.10827203884738312,0.42281992390670875,2.83114794885551,1.2843198530560844,1.8076837096952882,0.32720238221888853,0.2051773360142368,0.23034379731982801,3.4778121933586275,1.9279956909543667,1.0419435208087333,-0.2805982984743522,-1.0387835773100351,-0.9282442768948089,,,-1.7452348984911867,1.2990020678853498,1.908879372030375,0,4.050991596181866
64,yes_130.txt,"Treating vaccine-phobia and GM-aversion
Talk about first-world painswhile countries like India struggle to ensure full vaccination coverage, the president of the United States has to go on national television to urge parents to get their children vaccinated against measles. Vaccination is a hot issue in the US in February as anti-vaxxersparents suspicious about the benefits of vaccinationare blamed for an outbreak of measles. Originating from Disneyland in California, the infection wavefront reached New York on the East Coast last week. The numbers are piffling by Indian standardsjust over 100 cases in the US, while there were 156 deaths per day in India in 2011but for a nation which had been declared measles-free in the 21st century, it is a very big deal.
I just want people to know the facts and science and the information, president Barack Obama said in an NBC interview. Ironically, that is precisely what an Arizona doctor, who has become an anti-vaxxer mascot and media magnet, says in defence of his own position. He wants parents to look deeply into the vaccine vials that their children are injected with and evaluate their potential for being useless or harmful. The proposition is absurd, given that very, very few parents have the technical education to make an informed choice. Even a study linking the measles vaccine with autism which was dismissed long ago lingers in public awareness. Indeed, trying to persuade through the science of vaccination, whether for the motion or against it, is rather pointless. Lay people take decisions actuated by political and ethical concerns, and even suspicions, rather than technical issues.
In the US, vaccination is facing the very same brick wall that genetically-modified crops do in India while the evidence in favour of the technology is sufficient to convince the scientific mind, it appears mysterious and potentially suspicious to the lay person. India is firmly on the GM map of the world, now that the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications has reported it to be the worlds fourth-most-deeply invested nation, with 11.6 million hectares under GM crops. Thats neck and neck with Canada, but only about one-seventh of the acreage in the US, which leads the field.
Besides, almost all of the acreage in India is under Bt cotton. Nations which have voted firmly for GM, like Brazil, tend to have a wide bouquet of crops. The fact that India is almost GM-monocultural and a slow adopter indicates distrustlike the measles vaccine, this is a political rather than scientific reaction, and is being addressed politically. For instance, Maharashtra has just cleared open-field trials of GM chickpea, rice, cotton, maize and brinjala strong signal.
Partly, the distrust is not about science and technology, but proceeds from unease at the staggering bigness of big biotech and big pharma.
Could information asymmetry be an issue here? While policymakers are easily assured that they have adequate access to information and data that they may want in order to make up their minds, the public is never certain of any such thing, and naturally fearful of being diddled.
In the West, part of the resistance to vaccines comes from the suspicion that big pharma invests in influencing medical professionals, policymakers and institutions to market superfluous and overpriced products, procedures and standards. Besides, while the WHO lays down guidelines for vaccine use, in practice, paediatricians do offer parents a small spectrum of choice depending on the geography of risk. In a location where a disease is unknown, the vaccine for it may be quietly passed over in the clinic. The very existence of choice opens a perceptual door, encouraging parents to wonder if even essential vaccines are unnecessary, and only exist to fatten big pharma.
The core of the problem is that those who are convinced need no proof, and no proof ever suffices for the rest. The remedy is political persuasion rather than scoffing at fears and pushing them aside with the bludgeon of science. Persuasion has kept the gigantic oral polio vaccine programme rolling in India in the face of critics who considered the target to be unachievable. WHO declared India polio-free last year and now, measles is the next target. In the early 1990s, India was perceived to be heading for an HIV/AIDS pandemic that would have dwarfed the crisis in Uganda. It was averted by a huge outreach programme against high-risk behaviour driven by government and NGOs dismissed as lucrative scare-mongering at the timewhich used multiple modes of communication, from the press to street theatre. Today, a pandemic is impossible.
So, though it looks slightly absurd, the president of the United States was quite right to go to the media when he needed to fight back against measles. In the battle against communicable diseases, the TV studio has more leverage than the doctors clinic.",10,35,26.285714285714285,0,0.49855852521517696,0.32897900538597286,0.33914755160609883,0.3301948843612557,0.0,0.39286309358790333,0.3776737028809034,0.3154592991013612,0.31098601082634847,0.20265258550873877,0.1852357299898568,0.16253095596940034,0.1554444338416286,0.12305728160675027,1.0807604802233486,0.21275840985837588,0.12472529159440413,1.0700300944597168,0.21319598678071036,0.15467602219745627,1.3376995321523324,0.2660395139044734,0.15618889644256284,1.3406019130833806,0.26712650931324144,0.006666666666666666,0.0049628639334521685,0.0125,0.020370370370370372,3.122918089438731,3.54097430432762,0,0,1.0991170677213458,6.695883179277221,9.54697326651492,-0.6131884334026445,0.08360314258505559,0.7653971404123863,,-1.123739393156817,-0.7088873114008646,0.9691564389561008,0.9328701645099664,-0.7823310051255915,0.2640344660789238,0.4602827881245433,0.7237300516236168,0.20382040523640743,-0.5987400808062922,-0.5622903553930025,0.517578604716756,-0.4418020896306298,0.6606809194123163,0.832684049182137,0.7578558195977222,-0.01624339896845222,0.06545180374692013,0.031248812369478098,-0.294153338110445,0.05283905182559291,-0.10759921789504018,-0.2289097435572542,0.10136665913816133,-0.04608889140671168,-0.7689976925867374,-0.9044719888550466,-0.7569697375575394,-0.9201126876067244,-0.39941835903920936,-0.36522527115251596,,,-0.9969681094016951,0.4225739391788313,0.8319993739096936,0,2.4761757286028128
65,yes_131.txt,"This 7-Year-Old Wants You To Vaccinate Your Kids
If this appeal doesn't turn your anti-vaccination beliefs on their collective head, there is simply no hope left. In what can only be described as the cutest, if not most convincing, call for parents to vaccinate their children, 7-year-old cancer survivor Rhett Krawitt is begging parents to vaccinate their children, so that little boys and girls like Rhett, who have medical conditions that preclude the possibility of their own vaccinations, stay safe from highly contagious and potentially deadly diseases like measles. So even if you're not interested in keeping your own children safe, consider Rhett when making your decisions about the kids' next shots.
The Krawitt family lives in an area of California that boasts the highest proportion of school children with personal-belief exemptions from life-saving vaccines. And while the generally mentality surrounding vaccinations is self-preservation, it is also important to note that these shots are key to a phenomenon known as ""herd immunity,"" wherein enough people in a group are immune to a disease so as to prevent an outbreak. This means that even if one person were to contract a disease like measles, his or her community would remain relatively safe, given the high rate of vaccinated individuals. However, in certain areas of California, school districts are growing dangerously close to losing that factor, meaning that a single case of measles could spell disaster as it spreads, ill-contained, throughout a region.
For measles, the necessary proportion for effective herd immunity stands at 92 percent. In Marin County, where Rhett goes to school, fewer than 85 percent of children are fully vaccinated. Now that Rhett has successfully battled leukemia, he should not have to live in fear of contracting measles, a disease that was all but eradicated in the United States a few decades ago. Indeed, after undergoing the fight of his life so early on, the last thing he needs to do is battle stubborn parents who have latched onto unfounded claims and pseudoscience that is not only petulant, but now presenting a very real health risk.
The great irony of the refusal to vaccinate children, particularly in California, is that those who are choosing not to do so represent some of the wealthiest, and indeed, smartest citizens in America. In fact, according to a study conducted by Wired Magazine, just six out of the 12 Bay Area tech and biotech companies' daycare centers had vaccination rates that were conducive to herd immunity. And in one Google facility, just 49 percent of children were completely vaccinated. That, as former New York Jets linebacker Bart Scott would say, ""can't stop a nosebleed.""
Of course, in Google's defense, it is very likely that these numbers are outdated, as parents have yet to provide the updated vaccination records to the facilities. But still, with less than half of registered children up to date on their shots, the statistics are concerning.
And they're especially concerning to kids like Rhett, whose long bouts of chemotherapy and other drugs have rendered him incapable of receiving his measles vaccination for a full year after being first declared cancer-free. Although he'll be receiving his shot in a matter of days, he must also depend on other vaccinated children to keep him safe from measles and other highly infectious diseases. The Krawitt family took a stand against unvaccinated children in a rather high-profile push last month for statewide legislation that would disallow unvaccinated children from attending public schools.
In a speech on Tuesday to the school board and local elected officials, Rhett, who dressed to the nines for the occasion in a blue sports coat and green sneakers, told an enraptured audience,
For three and a half years, I took chemo to get the bad guys out. Now I can say 'Gone with the Cancer.' Soon we will say 'Gone with the Measles.' My name is Rhett, and I give a damn!
The school board sided with the 7-year-old, and while their vote was largely symbolic, it does represent a shift in the general attitude of a state that has now become infamous for its refusal to give its children their necessary shots. Rhett's father, Carl Krawitt, also spoke to the board, saying, ""Our culture emphasizes the individual story more than the need for people to see how their choices can infringe on the health of others. We have an obligation to send a message. The risk of getting any of these diseases go far beyond our school.""
In an interview with ABC News, Mr. Krawitt also noted, ""The importance of vaccinations is about the expectant mothers and babies under the age one and hundreds of children who are at risk for getting these disease that dont even need to be here. Its really around making sure that we have public health policy that protects everyone in our community."" The lack of vaccinations in the state has been markedly debilitating for Rhett and his family, who avoid things like public transportation for fear that he contract measles or a similar disease. And with 121 reported measles cases, 99 of which have been in California, their fears are far from unfounded.
So parents, listen to Rhett. He gives a damn, and so should you.",12,36,28.22222222222222,0,0.5259242445230484,0.35563159011533513,0.35316044837236404,0.3119587235980564,0.0,0.34572926198598,0.33931689179738383,0.335426448767957,0.3625701457000809,0.18652396709270155,0.17690047878640802,0.1928695915434032,0.20853286280193684,0.14462211534353875,1.2269056368999252,0.24575016528604976,0.1528993189021361,1.2966122974564147,0.2594061106878057,0.15412599613367142,1.319771376087178,0.2641782342171123,0.15908144575387653,1.3334229647380775,0.26887262926923294,0.05074786324786325,0.0400022635316753,0.02127659574468085,0.03986562150055991,3.1437095057194773,3.574015074531164,0,0,1.159239776541395,6.726899597153672,9.069613761898559,-0.4111584063688258,0.12680588386504243,1.1498554360872173,,-0.8910272659793136,-0.4973913777585646,1.0960188548516252,0.7649187026431336,-0.7823310051255915,-0.9698485449299848,-0.7748010650491897,0.9124765646196308,1.0274999575747832,-1.1229500823579162,-0.9856641089457558,1.0345575542021967,0.9140453815298991,1.177563085850953,1.2615191448897636,1.2367555969048878,1.1588213585927096,1.2220788690524136,1.1988830423779449,-0.352423327979258,-0.30687214674385394,-0.26704206833652766,0.1673026002531677,-0.058126592056647365,0.13870927380061832,0.6941233486132105,0.27252767929281096,-0.48904648631149883,0.15011961493903628,-0.10465767011701663,0.17764646071890158,,,0.2388759802915585,0.5232272746839617,-0.8396652565437777,0,1.1574472509634504
66,yes_134.txt,"How the U.S. went from eliminating measles to a measles outbreak at Disneyland
In 2000, the United States declared that measles had been eliminated. But the country experienced a record number of measles cases last year, while an outbreak this month that began at Disneyland has been linked to dozens of cases in California and other states.
This has raised obvious concerns, both because of the overall anti-vaccination movement in this country and because its not considered a good thing for a virus to suddenly surge back into circulation. So, how did we get here? How did we travel from elimination to a record number of cases and a new, dangerous outbreak in just 15 years? Let us take a walk through the recent history of measles and the United States.
ELIMINATION
First, it is important to know that elimination does not really mean eradication. When the United States said that measles had been eliminated in the country, this did not mean there would be no other cases within the nations borders; rather, it meant that it was no longer endemic. In other words, any measles cases that occurred would come from people traveling to the country. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines measles elimination as 12 months or more without continuous disease transmission in a geographic area.)
BEFORE AND AFTER ELIMINATION
Before the virus was eliminated and before vaccinations became routine in 1963 (well, for the most part, but well get back to that in a moment), it infected millions of people each year and was responsible for hundreds of deaths. The CDC says that until that point, every year 3 to 4 million people were infected, 48,000 of them went to the hospital and 400 to 500 people died.
After the elimination declaration in 2000, between 37 and 220 people reported having measles each year in the United States until last year.
WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR?
The number of measles cases in the country skyrocketed, nearly tripling the highest number seen in the preceding 13 years. As noted above, there were no more than 220 cases in a given year between 2001 and 2013. In 2014, there were 644 cases stemming from nearly two dozen outbreaks.
The jump was dramatic, with more cases just last year than there were in the five preceding years combined.
VACCINATIONS AND THE ANTI-VACCINE MOVEMENT
Obviously, the recent surge in cases is highlighting the still-extant anti-vaccination movement in the United States. Celebrities like Jenny McCarthy, among others, have been given large platforms from which to express their views about the dangers of vaccinations, even though the gas that seemingly fueled the anti-vaccination movement for so long a medical study published in 1998 was retracted in 2012. (My colleague Terry McCoy has much more here about the doctor who wrote the retracted paper.)
There are other reasons a person may not get vaccinated, of course, ranging from religious or philosophical reasons to someone moving to the country and not being aware of or able to obtain the vaccination. Yet there is a different danger posed by people who choose not to get vaccinations for their children: A recent study found that these people are clustered together, which means that measles, a highly-contagious disease, can more easily spread to additional children.
Ultimately, the vast majority of children in the United States are vaccinated for measles. The majority of people who get measles have not been vaccinated. In California, for example, half of the people with measles in the current outbreak have not been vaccinated (and vaccination status is still not known for many of the others).
Still, even if people arent getting vaccinated, they arent spontaneously developing measles. The disease has to come from somewhere. A huge number of measles cases originate outside the United States, as measles remains common in other countries. (The CDC estimates that each year, about 20 million people around the world get measles and that 122,000 people die from it.)
The only way it can come is from other countries, usually from U.S. travelers who travel abroad and who are not protected through vaccinations, who get infected overseas and bring it back, Jane Seward, deputy director of the CDCs viral disease division, told me during one of the outbreaks last year.
A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics last year found that 88 percent of measles cases in the country were internationally imported or epidemiologically or virologically linked to importation. There were a few cases not linked to any kind of importation over a period from 2001 to 2011, but they did not seem to be endemic, researchers said. The study ultimately found that while endemic measles was still eliminated, international importation remained a serious risk.
As long as people are traveling to and from other countries, and as long as some of these people may be unvaccinated and they may come into contact with other unvaccinated people, the risk remains of measles cases in the United States.
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA?
There are 59 confirmed cases of measles in California residents this month, and 42 of those cases were tied to exposure at Disneyland or Disneys California Adventure Park, the states Department of Public Health said Wednesday. (The CDC says there are also cases in five other states.)
Those 59 people ranged from seven months to 70 years old. The vaccination status of 34 of these people is known, the health department said, and all but six of those people had not been vaccinated. One other person had received one of the two recommended doses.
The situation in the state points to a specific danger presented by an infectious disease that can be spread by people who have traveled overseas and those who have not been vaccinated. Travelers from overseas who do not live in the United States or visit it frequently will often go to tourist attractions such as theme parks, which draw very large crowds. If those crowds contain people who have not been vaccinated, they can potentially contract a disease and bring it back to a community full of other people who may be susceptible.
For public health officials in the state, they are monitoring possible measles cases and expecting additional cases to emerge in the near future. They also have a clear message about what they say can help stave off this sort of thing. The best way to prevent measles and its spread is to get vaccinated, Ron Chapman, director of the health department, said Wednesday.",24,51,23.92156862745098,0,0.6475256031379104,0.44035229366455303,0.27712819660599863,0.28482961839634097,0.0784313725490196,0.4096202024486172,0.35971807507454534,0.31517495266501466,0.2954061766614232,0.22357292011209573,0.18982693605100606,0.17340804820559966,0.17652252580294037,0.13941149156282218,1.0540627932788114,0.21914710545177146,0.14324759975769955,1.1336543321140191,0.23154635540160612,0.17287693703938675,1.4077555269524484,0.28477723849663367,0.1675657692522841,1.3950834299648014,0.2799907772360038,0.06523487773487774,0.05867026492026492,0.06153846153846154,0.0542571931884909,3.131688420948586,3.5318947649951524,0,0,1.0752049899149347,6.248314218091043,8.951454366607463,0.8010217558340866,0.7748470030648452,0.29603918252970957,,0.14304424928318824,0.17489179769775764,0.40767901292266284,0.5150649676967963,-0.47167050412328587,0.7027068853188218,-0.11788586956031333,0.7210421668108414,-0.044953580445117616,0.08120958084493413,-0.329088488286867,0.7029273394681996,0.09652006912077332,1.0526709331385085,0.7543447774855072,0.850592470233597,0.7562734767216195,0.39023245424429154,0.49492466353379844,1.634059147211482,1.458445170209625,1.4975309729347765,1.3294586560900141,1.311771559617467,1.3153829254090441,1.174969091561144,0.8995998235446193,0.7400280089150933,0.9401748341290758,-0.27508104006999706,-0.5144053662788248,,,-1.4884895429716278,-1.0298603487328801,-1.2534474897531886,0,3.7625733922674045
67,yes_135.txt,"Mandatory vaccination is not the answer to measles
Measles. It used to be just a disease. Now its become a banner under which politicians gather to threaten one of our most sacred rights - the right to give informed consent for medical treatment.
Whether you are for vaccines, against them, or neutral, allow me to ask this question: Is vaccination a medical treatment which should fall under the protection of informed consent, or does the government have the right to force them on every American?
As a pediatrician, I give patients the MMR vaccine almost every day in my office. And I follow the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control which mandate that I provide informed consent. The American Medical Association describes informed consent as a patients right of self-decision and a basic policy in both ethics and law that physicians must honor.
If vaccines were harmless to every single person who received them, then I could understand putting this decision in the hands of our elected officials. But here are two salient facts:
 About 2,000 severe reactions are reported to the CDC each year which result in prolonged hospitalization, permanent disability, or death. Most reactions arent even reported, so the true number may be even higher. Yet, because they cant be proven, the medical community denies that they can happen.
 Over $3 billion have been paid out to victims of vaccine reactions. Not $3 million. Not $30 million. Not even $300 million. But $3 billion. Are we paying that much money to victims of pretend reactions? I think not.
You might think its the actual measles outbreak that is responsible for the current political hysteria. But it is not. Instead, it is a carefully crafted opportunistic attempt to overstate what measles could potentially do to our nation. It is what politicians, some media outlets, and some in the medical community are trying to portray measles to be. But lets look at the actual facts of the current outbreak:
 As of Feb. 17, there are 141 cases nationwide. Not thousands. According to the Orange County Public Health Department, no new cases have been reported in the OC since Feb. 4.
 After the initial surge, it is now moving slowly. It is not spreading like wildfire in an exponential explosion of unprecedented proportion.
 Last years 640 cases were an anomaly because over 400 occurred in one Amish community in New York and over 100 cases hit an unvaccinated church community in Texas. But for the rest of highly-vaccinated America, last years measles was business as usual. This year we are off to a tough start, but its slowing down.
 It has killed no one. It can kill about 1 person in every 1000 cases. Will someone die of measles in the United States in the years to come? Maybe. But it hasnt killed anyone in the past 15 years or more.
 The last time measles hit us hard was 25 years ago. Not last year, not this year, yet.
 Its measles, people. Its not the plague. Its not polio. Its not Ebola. Its measles. If the plague hits, lets force everyone to vaccinate. But measles? Measles? We need something a lot more dangerous than that if we are going to rob each and every patient of the sacred right of informed consent.
Lets stop panicking over what measles might do and calmly examine what it is doing. It has a small and intermittent presence in our country. It makes people sick, then they get over it. It has complications, but rarely so. Vaccination is important and protective. But it cannot be forced; a parent must give consent.
If you would rather make your own medical decisions within the sacred confines of the doctor/patient relationship, then let Sacramento know now. If you would rather give politicians the power to make medical decisions for you, then give them your support. But you better hurry; the outbreak is winding down, and so is the fear. Give them the power before its too late. Im sure theyll make plenty of other wise medical decisions for you in the years to come.

68,yes_136.txt,"Disneyland Measles Outbreak: An Alert For India
Disneyland: the place synonymous with Mickey Mouse, great childhood memories and now... measles! The measles outbreak in California appears to be spreading to other states in the US, its source believed to be Disneyland and the adjacent California Adventure Park in Anaheim.
Unfortunately, a majority of the affected individuals were not vaccinated, the easiest way to avoid this disease. This alarming trend of non-vaccination has been growing in America due to parents who believe (against all scientific evidence) that vaccination is unnecessary or even harmful to their children. This is a great disservice to the community as a less than 80% immunisation rate can adversely affect ""herd immunity"" - contagious infections are less likely to reach epidemic proportions because if a majority of people have immunity against a disease, it cannot spread easily.
This trend in America is surprisingly growing in affluent, educated communities where people are opting not to vaccinate their children because they do not want to put ""chemicals"" in their bodies. Unfortunately, people have become complacent and have forgotten that before 1963 (the year that the measles vaccine was introduced), there were 30 to 40 lakh cases of measles every year in America. Out of sight, out of mind!
This serves as a lesson for countries like India, which are working hard to eradicate these preventable diseases in very difficult circumstances. Just last year the WHO declared India polio free and, interestingly, measles is being targeted as the next disease for eradication. Here is the challenge though: once we declare a disease ""eradicated"" it is very easy to get complacent and for parents to forget lessons of the past (or believe pseudoscience) and choose not to vaccinate their children. Government agencies also have to maintain a sense of urgency as complacency can lead to the disease roaring back to life. Remember, measles was declared ""eliminated"" from America in 2000 and here we are a decade and half later, confronting a very preventable outbreak again. As the age-old mantra goes: prevention is definitely better than cure.",5,15,26.533333333333335,0,0.5806281786145908,0.4235335952291886,0.4099564829841256,0.3786921173830827,0.26666666666666666,0.4163743555545807,0.39450483814311715,0.2860976600635146,0.305340465977539,0.222727682441473,0.20048385692330506,0.13485609126011175,0.16238417264877034,0.12333095509541148,1.0652700392472156,0.21139474685020013,0.12945008766690383,1.0987141463706522,0.21910131232869867,0.15536698031664795,1.3524304207756068,0.2685957832757863,0.16540359092473841,1.381231664874733,0.2775983306668999,0.007142857142857143,0.01661654135338346,0,0.03076923076923077,3.0983924929658095,3.539311717196047,0,0,1.06666196781743,6.395741983662152,9.420931972196287,-1.1182635009871913,-0.7804516830146815,0.8145573814986766,,-0.425836904118113,0.04143058317183721,1.6102081965928674,1.3795201632832446,0.2739146982822475,0.8795190494896918,1.0022429460656965,0.4461788198865922,0.11367408669959055,0.053737789449084784,0.21221020576486022,0.04599106579593366,-0.2645652134139205,0.6672405315773157,0.787230303812702,0.7380612405439022,0.18081544855861542,0.21187438391443325,0.1804641718226892,-0.22095294769981477,0.34840015601355273,0.1113785519834143,1.0332902417635161,1.0040296811782372,1.0621816863934073,-0.753192216343597,-0.5130162386641421,-1.1385573984231125,-0.34924564751560805,-0.7471186606911234,-0.39254217538761194,,,-1.6640944612217394,-0.551433200571871,0.3906155287124225,0,4.093432781853002
69,yes_137.txt,"Santa Monica-Malibu School District Encourages Immunization For Measles:
The Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District is encouraging parents to have their students immunized against preventable diseases, such as pertussis and measles, currently on the rise in Southern California.
The measles outbreak in Orange County underscores the importance of immunizing as many children in the community as possible to help prevent the spread of this deadly disease.
Measles is extremely contagious and can be undetected in the onset stage. SMMUSD has students in the district who are immune deficient due to a variety of medical conditions.
Exposure to unimmunized children poses a risk to these students whose immune systems are unable to protect them. The more district and community members who are immunized, the safer the environment for these fragile students. Infants too young to be immunized and the elderly in the community are also at high risk by unimmunized students.
The district would like to remind families that during an outbreak of a preventable disease such as measles, unimmunized students (including those who have not provided documentation of immunization) may be excluded from school for the length of the incubation period, in some cases up to 21 days, according to Lora Morn, RN, MSN, SMMUSD coordinating nurse.
The district has cooperated with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health in the past and when they have recommended that students be excluded, the district has excluded.
SMMUSD encourages students and adults who have not been immunized to get immunized. Westside Family Clinic at 1711 Ocean Park Blvd. in Santa Monica provides free immunizations for children under 18 years old the first Saturday of each month from 12-2 pm. No appointment is necessary.
The district reminds parents that if they ever signed an immunization waiver and subsequently DID have their child immunized to please provide the school with an updated record of immunizations immediately. School staff can provide a list of required immunizations and instructions for sending to the school.
Thank you for helping to keep the SMMUSD community healthy by immunizing your children and keeping the nurses updated on their immunization status, Morn said.",10,17,22.88235294117647,0,0.6907168221659958,0.5288382480811218,0.2146337163945039,0.21873155968884628,0.11764705882352941,0.33362587205157046,0.33997219636493864,0.17471120271718862,0.27204246679764416,0.27066632269359214,0.2225983399123334,0.15328114748452648,0.19704125344221082,0.0899482335939561,0.5297013899347783,0.12368989617261937,0.12546395181394743,1.0074168051967054,0.2073390576688769,0.15842348729242917,1.2590354432912783,0.26161909269276357,0.1541297000896792,1.2491729905668802,0.25588288370007234,0.09696969696969697,0.051666666666666666,0.07317073170731707,0.0545876887340302,3.1750965488776224,3.5801721538241615,0,0,1.2009361911800935,6.630316815072913,9.329313323244175,-0.6131884334026445,-0.6940462004547078,0.08972188113815376,,0.5103329853232497,0.8770533228779082,-0.1580998457963773,-0.09368518156081944,-0.3163402536221331,-1.2866945705578847,-0.7537003513184363,-0.6067408892429594,-0.4180180920176618,1.6118324775817403,1.335474693231004,0.359959246331725,0.6205563897648899,-0.13290166390151578,-0.7842937768256393,-0.5350396573555771,0.014564180733137757,-0.2541682902039547,-0.11674366926634341,0.10285467204672148,-1.5254801900277786,-0.4862658755354562,-0.5109720095835374,-1.9298913196068097,-1.2360422943571718,2.22829534770336,0.6643437142834299,1.0951264700582906,0.9583180735426943,0.3403176187041138,0.2788094868368773,,,1.0959609088310849,0.20980039194343597,0.06977630070487484,0,-3.489711347851986

Readers respond: Measles Vaccinate all or allow for choice?
Dont allow diseases to gain a foothold again
The only way vaccines work is to have 95 percent compliance within a populace. This level allows the 5 percent of the population who are too young for the vaccine or immune compromised (such as those undergoing bone marrow or chemo treatment) to be protected by the rest of us.
As an RN, I volunteer with Los Angeles County Public Health in their vaccine outreach clinics. I welcome parents questions about vaccines and always try to ease their concerns by steering them to the latest public health information. Still, Im surprised by the misinformation some have about vaccine safety. Often this misinformation is fueled by blogs and websites with little to no medical backing.
I tell our clients that these diseases were deadly several generations back. Our parents and grandparents lost friends, family members and classmates to diseases like polio and measles. Its only the push for full vaccination that has nearly eradicated what was once every parents fear.
Unlike many countries, we have the knowledge and the ability to control the return and spread of these deadly diseases. We owe it those who lost their lives to them. We cant allow these diseases to gain a foothold here again.
 Lori Cruit, Santa Clarita
Heres a win-win situation
Again, the tension between personal liberty and majoritarian democracy come to the forefront of U.S. politics and policy. The solution can be as simple as letting anti-vaxxers, for whatever reason, refrain from having their children vaccinated and enabling any public or private institution to refrain from allowing unvaccinated persons to assemble with their constituency. This way both can be responsible and secure within reason. We dont need more laws to force one of the opposing perspectives to compromise their standards.
 J Peter Armerding, Oak Park
Based on junk science
Killing kids in the name of God or pseudoscience is just plain wrong. Allowing dangerous epidemics that could easily be eradicated by vaccinations is wrong.
A favorite argument of the uninformed is to produce some heartrending cases of kids whose health self-destructed after being vaccinated. Hey, I can produce a list of people who died a week after drinking milk. Does that prove that drinking milk is dangerous to your health? No.
All such facts must be studied in their proper statistical and scientific context. Truth is in the details, not the headlines. Scientists completed studies and now we have a scientific consensus that there is no problem. A scientific consensus easily trumps a few loose cannons.

How much tolerance should we have for parents who would knowingly expose their children and society at large to the spread of measles a virus that is known to cause pneumonia and the risk of death, deafness from severe ear infections, swelling of the brain and brain damage, and cause pregnant women to deliver prematurely or underweight babies?
I say no tolerance. Parents or religious doctrines that advocate such negligent conduct are themselves a plague.

71,yes_139.txt,"Vaccinate Before Vacation
RENO, NV - With growing concerns about measles and whooping cough in our schools this year, health officials say getting vaccinated before you travel is more important than ever. In January, 59 cases of measles were linked to contact with an infected person at Disneyland.
Lynnette Bellin of Immunize Nevada says exposure can happen even before you get to your destination. ""Any travel, whether it's domestically or international, you're going to be at airports where it's very likely people could be traveling from countries that do not have as strict a vaccine standards as we do,"" she says.
Most school-aged children are vaccinated, but parents may need to get up to date. If you're unsure of your immunization history, there's a website than can help. It's called Nevada WebIZ (https://izrecord.nv.gov). Using your name, date of birth and social security number, the system will pull up your immunization records. It may even recommend vaccines based on your history.
For college students, Bellin says Hepatitis A and B shots can help protect against food and drink-borne illness. She also recommends meningitis vaccinations for that age group. If you aren't sure about a vaccine you've had in the past, she says there's no danger of ""over-vaccination.""
""There's a lot of science behind the schedules that we have put together and how our bodies will best work with that schedule so... no, there's no risk of getting too many vaccines at once.""
It usually takes about two weeks for a vaccine to be fully effective, but it's not too late to get shots for the upcoming break.

72,yes_14.txt,"Disney, Measles and the Fantasyland of Vaccine Perfection
Americans, surely you can tell when something sounds too good to possibly be true!
Okay, my fellow Americans. Time to turn off your TVs, put down your propaganda-papers (i.e. newspapers), and put on your thinking caps. Vaccines are being touted as a quick fix, for everyone, regardless of age, weight, family history, or health status (before it can even be observed or determined in the case of fetuses, newborns, infants, and toddlers!), for an ever-growing number of infectious and non-infectious diseases, as though there are no adverse side effects or short- and long-term consequences to consider. Clearly, there's a big problem with what people are being told and sold when it comes to vaccines. Yet, worldwide, people are being manipulated by the false promise of the end to all disease with nothing more than a quick jab, pill, or spray up the nose. Beware of being manipulated by such farce. Here are a few facts and thoughts for you to consider, especially with regards to all of the Disneyland measles hype.
1. Has there been any laboratory confirmation of even one case of the supposed measles related to Disneyland? If yes, was the confirmed case tested to determine whether it was wild-type measles or vaccine-strain measles? If not, why not? These are important questions to ask. Is it measles or not? If yes, what kind, because if it's vaccine-strain measles, then that means it is the vaccinated who are contagious and spreading measles resulting in what the media likes to label ""outbreaks"" to create panic (strange how they've completely missed the Autism outbreak going on for the past 25 years). It would be what one might call vaccine fallout. People who receive live-virus vaccines, such as the MMR, can then shed that live virus, for up to many weeks...and can infect others. Multiply that in your head by all of the people who receive not only the MMR live-virus vaccine, but many others. Other live-virus vaccines include the nasal flu vaccine, shingles vaccine, rotavirus vaccine, chicken pox vaccine, and yellow fever vaccine.
It has recently been discovered that those who are vaccinated with the DTaP and TDaP vaccines, if subsequently exposed to and infected with pertussis, can then harbor pertussis in their throats, for weeks, which can then spread to others causing them to contract pertussis, even if the one harboring it in their throat remains asymptomatic. Talk about a hidden disease vector! Parents of infants should be wary of those who've received either of these vaccines, because if a DTaP or TDaP recipient is infected with pertussis, they may not know it, and since they might not have the telling cough, then no one else has any way to know they might be contagious and transmitting pertussis, either. This certainly dismantles the ""cocooning"" theory that has been used to scare parents of newborns and infants into not permitting any adult, including Grandma and Grandpa, near their baby who hasn't had a TDaP booster.
Thus, it is often the vaccinated who are spreading disease, despite what the media tell you, media that are heavily supported and influenced by pharmaceutical advertising dollars. Why aren't those who receive live-virus vaccines quarantined in their homes until it can be confirmed that they are no longer contagious with the diseases against which they were vaccinated? Why are they being allowed into schools, hospitals, grocery stores, and the like? Why are those who have received the DTaP and TDaP vaccines not mandated to be tested for pertussis being harbored in their throats before being allowed near newborns and infants?
2. Did you know that historical statistical figures for reported measles cases have been fraught with error? For but one example, I will refer to doctor-diagnosed ""measles"" cases in the UK in the late 1990s, where a serious problem emerged. A government scientist discovered that only 1 in 40 reported cases of measles was actually confirmed to be measles after lab testing. This discovery throws into question historical, and current, figures for measles. If reported cases are not required to be lab-confirmed, then this scientists discovery would lead us to believe that there has been gross over-reporting of measles cases, past and present.
Daily Telegraph 8 January 1997 London (Europe Today): ""97.5% of the times that British doctors diagnose measles they are wrong"", says a publication of the Public Health Laboratory service. The mistake being made by National Health GP's was found when the services tested the saliva of more than 12,000 children who had been diagnosed as having measles. Roger Buttery, an adviser on transmissible diseases at the Cambridge and Huntingdon Health Department, said that the majority of doctors ""say they can recognize measles a mile off, but we now know that this illness occurs only in 2.5% of the cases."" Buttery says that doctors classify as measles many other viruses that also cause spots. He found eight different viruses during the survey in East Anglia. One of them, parvovirus, gives symptoms similar to German measles. The reason for the high rate of error puzzled Buttery. ""Doctors are neither vague nor careless,"" he said. The solution is to defer the diagnosis until more detailed information can be got. There are 5,000 to 6,000 cases of measles registered each year in the United Kingdom, but these findings now call most of them into doubt.""
Geez, ever wonder if that might be happening at Disneyland, and beyond...and for multiple diseases against which we vaccinate, including the ""flu""?
3. Why isnt the media reporting on the ineffectiveness and the dangers of the MMR vaccine, as exposed and evidenced by recent whistleblowers...2 from Merck, and 1 from the CDC? Again, one must ask why America's mainstream media have refused to report on these whistleblowers (can you say cha-ching from those non-stop pharma ads on TV and in the propaganda-papers), especially given the gravity of the vaccine research fraud they have exposed, and what that fraud means for parents making vaccine decisions, not to mention what it means for the vulnerable and innocent children receiving the vaccines.
4. Why have parents been denied choice with regards to being allowed to choose monovalent vaccines over the trivalent MMR vaccine? Ever since Dr. Andrew Wakefield dared to do the unthinkable...i.e. question a vaccine (gasp! like big pharma would ever sell a product that might cause problems, or death...gasp again!), in this case, the MMR vaccine...government officials and committee members decided they did not like the people questioning vaccines, so they colluded with Merck and other profiteers to stop the production of the monovalent measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines, forcing consumers to use the trivalent MMR vaccine (a 3-in-1 vaccine, which has the potential to be far more dangerous than individual vaccines given separately and at different times).
*See footnote at the bottom to see Merck's ""explanation"" of why they discontinued the monovalent M, M, and R vaccines. Then, look up who comprises the ACIP (see anyone who might possibly have a conflict of interest, say someone who might just profit from the approval and sale of vaccines?). Ask yourself who the ""professional societies"" might be, and if they by chance might just happen to greatly profit from vaccines and their numerous after-effects. And those ""scientific leaders"", might they be scientists who work at or for Merck, or have a chair endowed for them by Merck? Last mentioned are customers. Guess those customers who want to have a choice, and who want the 3 monovalent vaccines, don't matter much to Merck.
5. Clearly, the MMR is not the highly effective vaccine it is touted to be, as evidenced by so many vaccinated individuals reportedly contracting the measles (and mumps, for that matter). Nor is the MMR vaccine the highly safe vaccine it is touted to be, as evidenced by reports to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System. Many more people in the U.S. have died from this vaccine (and from the MMR-Varicella quadrivalent vaccine) than from the measles in the past 2 decades, and parents need to factor that fact into their decision whether or not to vaccinate their children. 
6. If babies under age 12-15 months are contracting actual measles, one must ask 2 questions: a.) Is the mom exclusively breastfeeding so that maternal immunity is being passed on to her baby? If not, the baby misses out on important protection gained from its mothers immunity, and may be more susceptible to illness. (I realize that not every mother is able to breastfeed. I have helped a mother who didnt produce enough breastmilk to connect with other nursing mothers who were willing to share their surplus, which is something moms in this situation might want to consider). If the baby was unable to nurse properly from the get-go, look no further than the effects of the birth dose of the Hep B vaccine, which has been shown to negatively affect innate infant reflexes needed to locate a mothers breast and latch on to it. b.) If the mom was vaccinated with the MMR herself at any point, her ability to acquire and pass on natural, protective immunity to her infant via breastfeeding has been impaired, possibly ruinedmeaning the vaccine is to blame, not the unvaccinated.
7. If parents are taking their very young children to dirty, unsanitary places with thousands and thousands of people, they have made the choice to expose their children to multitudinous germs and illnesses from multitudinous people, leaving them in no position to finger point at others. It can, and should, be argued that to the maximum extent possible, infants should be kept at home for the first few months of life and away from extremely crowded places for perhaps their first couple of years, giving their immune systems time to develop and mature. 
8. If vaccines work, the vaccinated should be protected. If they don't work, ask yourself why are you allowing them and exposing your child to such incredible risks? Furthermore, if they don't work, as is often the case, feel free to have your child vaccinated again and again (no one is stopping you), but don't expect others to vaccinate their children with scores of products that have long track records of not working and of wreaking havoc.
9. It was not ever, is not today, and will not be tomorrow my child's job to protect your child, in any way, shape, or form. That is the parent's job. Period. Ask yourself who exactly is making these decisions as to which child is more worthy of living, since death and disability are possible consequences of both the disease and the vaccine. Since there is a decision to be made, it should reside with the parent, or with the vaccine recipient, not with anyone else, and most certainly not with the ones profiting from vaccines, be it directly (pharmaceutical companies, doctors, and hospitals) or indirectly (elected officials, government regulators, and trade industry groups, all of whom enjoy plenty of big pharma dollars and perks).
10. There is no longer any excuse, nor is it acceptable, for any parent, doctor, media person, elected official, or government regulator to state the false claims that vaccines are safe and effective. They are neither, and not even one has ever been proven to be such. As a matter of fact, ""highly secret documents"" from pharmaceutical companies, in addition to pharmaceutical company and CDC whistleblowers, continue to reveal and expose on a regular basis that vaccines are neither safe nor effective, and never have been. 
Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court has officially and legally declared vaccines to be ""unavoidably unsafe. For those who find that a hard-to-decipher double negative, that means that vaccines are inherently dangerous, yet, they are mandated for children. As a colleague of mine recently commented, If you dont have a choice about unavoidably unsafe products, what the hell choices do you have that are meaningful?
It is also imperative to remember that in 1986, the U.S. Congress was foolish enough to cave in to a bunch of whining vaccine-making pharmaceutical companies who said they weren't going to make vaccines anymore because they were losing so many costly lawsuits due to their vaccines killing and maiming people. This whining, no doubt paired with lobbying, resulted in Congress indemnifying vaccine-making pharmaceutical companies, and those who administer vaccines, from liability for injuries and deaths caused by vaccines. Yes, you heard that correctly. Not Liable. With that Act of Congress, any incentive or means of accountability to make a safe vaccine product flew right out the window.
It is critical for any person who is considering vaccination for themselves, their children, or those in their care, such as elderly parents, to take the time to educate himself/herself regarding vaccine history, vaccine ingredients, vaccine adverse events, vaccine trials, vaccine research fraud, vaccine injuries, and vaccine deaths. Vaccination is a risky medical procedure, and as such, it should not be entered into lightly or without due diligence.
11. Vaccine mandates for children are extremely age discriminatory, and parents should begin to sue over this fact. Notice that those doing the mandating aren't rolling up their sleeves and pant legs, and dropping their drawers, for 70+ dastardly vaccine cocktails. Rather, they sit back and order that infants, toddlers, and young children be shot up to hell and back, stripping parents of their rights and freedoms, just so long as those pharmaceutical companies keep filling their campaign coffers and providing perks.
12. It is time to stop delegating your health care decisions to your pediatrician and instead become your own expert. Your child is counting on you. Your child's pediatrician is not the vaccine expert you think he/she is. Their ""vaccine training"" in medical school, reported to be as brief as 2 hours, revolved around learning how and where to give a tiny baby up to 12 vaccines at one time from 8 syringes. Once you allow the toxic cocktails of heinous vaccine materials to enter your child's body, you can't retrieve them. They have now entered a closed system, a system which includes your child's brain, nerves, and blood, during critical developmental periods. Think about that. Think hard. There is no do-over. Trust me, I speak from experience about the no do-over part.
13. Glimpse of our future, which has actually already arrived. Have you thought about who is going to be able to defend our country now that we have children being environmentally injured to the extent of 1 in 6 having a neurodevelopmental disorder (that's code name for brain damage), 1 in 11 having asthma, 1 in 12 having food allergies (some of which are life-threatening, and all of which are life-altering), 1 in 50 having Autism, 1 in 400 having Type 1 Diabetes, many having GI and colon problems, seizure disorders, etc.? 
Here's how it's going to look when the alarm sounds and our health- and development-impaired young Americans are called to battle: ""Wait! I need to grab my EpiPen!"" ""Well, I need my inhaler."" ""I need gluten-free, casein-free, soy-free to-go meals! ""I can't find my prescription meds!"" ""NO ONE can bring peanuts, or any tree nuts for that matter, on this mission!"" ""Oh no! My insulin pod just fell off, and I don't have a new one to put on!"" ""I'm having chronic diarrhea, so I can't come along today!"" ""Well, I haven't pooped for a month and my stomach is killing me, so I cant go either! ""I can't follow more than 2 instructions at once, so I'm already confused and we haven't even left yet."" And then there are the ones who cant talk at all, arent toilet-trained, and who have the skill level of a toddlerthey wont be eligible to serve in any, way, shape, or form. Apparently, the military is already experiencing this, and has written a report titled Ready, Willing, and Unable to Serve. This is our future, folks.
Tragically, these same issues have affected our kids' back-to-school-supplies. Instead of scissors, crayons, and pencils, it's EpiPens, inhalers, insulin, prescription meds, special foods, and lengthy IEPs.
14. If you still are not getting the picture, then please hotfoot it over to your nearest elementary, junior high, or high school and ask to see the special education classrooms (that's right, plural, classrooms). Notice how many kids are in each one. Notice how oddly behaved they are. This is our new normal. Vaccinate your child, and you'll stand a good chance of experiencing firsthand what I'm talking about.
15. A warning, one I wish had been issued to me back in 1992: Beware of those ""well-baby"" appointments. Your baby may never be well again if you allow him/her to be vaccinated.
Please don't be led like a lamb to the slaughter with your baby in hand, and a fistful of syringes in the nurse's hand...syringes destined for your tiny baby's developing body, ready to destroy its immune system, nervous system, neurological development, and health, all in one fell swoop. Those syringes might even take your child's life. 
Don't be manipulated. Be responsible for making your own well-researched decisions.

October 21, 2009 
Dear Health Care Provider:
Monovalent vaccines no longer available for measles, mumps, rubella
Based on input from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), professional societies, scientific leaders, and customers, Merck has decided not to resume production of ATTENUVAX (Measles Virus Vaccine Live), MUMPSVAX (Mumps Virus Vaccine Live), and MERUVAXII (Rubella Virus Vaccine Live). This science-based decision will support vaccination of the largest group of appropriate individuals.

73,yes_140.txt,"Frieden: Vaccination is only way to stop measles
Measles is a personal enemy of mine. My first assignment at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a disease detective 25 years ago was to investigate a large measles outbreak in New York City. Many of the cases were children under a year old. Nationally, there were more than 55,000 cases, and more than 100 children died. By increasing vaccinations, we ended the New York outbreak and the national outbreak was ended by a push to vaccinate every child by age 2.
But now I'm having, as Yogi Berra said, dj vu all over again.
It's only February, and already we've had 141 measles cases in 17 states and Washington, D.C. At least 80 percent of the patients have been part of a large, ongoing outbreak linked to Disneyland. It's not clear how this outbreak began, although most likely an unvaccinated person brought measles to the United States after international travel.
Beating last year
This is a rough start to the year, especially after the lamentable record set just last year: 644 measles cases in 27 states. This was the most cases we had seen in the U.S. since we eliminated measles in 2000.
Worldwide, measles kills 17 people each hour of the day, most of them children. A lot more will become deaf or suffer brain damage. And every one of the 20 million cases of measles that people around the world get each year could be prevented.
Measles is probably the most contagious of all infectious diseases. From four days before through four days after the rash appears, people infected with measles virus can spread the disease to others. Nine out of 10 people who aren't immune will get measles if they are exposed to it. And the infectious person doesn't even have to be in the room: Measles can linger in the air for up to two hours.
So make sure you and your family are up to date on your measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine the vaccine that protects against all three diseases. If you're planning to travel abroad, check with your doctor to make sure you're protected against measles.
It's not just about you and your family. In your neighborhood, in your place of worship, in your school, in your neighborhood child care center, at your grocery store, throughout your community, there are infants too young to be immunized. And there are people with weakened immune systems who can't be immunized. Like young infants, they are vulnerable to infection and likely to suffer severe, life-threatening measles if they are exposed. It's more than about protecting your family. It's the right thing to do.
One in 12
Study after study shows that the measles vaccine is safe and that it works. And cost shouldn't be a factor. For more than two decades, the Vaccines for Children Program has offered the MMR vaccine to children whose families might not be able to pay. And the Affordable Care Act requires all new insurance plans to cover vaccinations, including MMR, at no cost to patients. We've made progress in national MMR vaccination coverage but one in 12 children in the USA is still not receiving the first dose of the MMR vaccine on time. This means many children remain susceptible longer than they should and, when many such children live in the same community, outbreaks can and do occur.
Policies that allow people to readily opt out of vaccinating their children for non-medical reasons should change. It needs to be harder to not get a vaccine than to get one. If parents do opt out, they should do so only after understanding the full implications of putting their children and others at risk perhaps by requiring that they meet with a doctor and their local health department and that they renew that decision and process every year.
Just more than a year ago, CDC honored Dr. Sam Katz on the 50th anniversary of the measles vaccine, of which he was co-inventor. He humbly said he did not deserve the congratulations. Save them, he said, for the real heroes: those who make use of the vaccine and who work to make it universally available.
Be one of Sam Katz's heroes. More than 2 billion people have been vaccinated worldwide in just the past 14 years, saving more than 15 million lives. The simple truth is that vaccination isn't just the best way to stop measles the only way.

74,yes_141.txt,"Study: Doctors have sway when it comes to parents choice for measles vaccine
The biggest headline all week has been the measles outbreak and subsequently vaccinations. Can I share one more? Because a local doctor and researcher recorded pediatricians and parents during child well-visits and he found out what might be causing more parents to opt out of vaccinations.
Its understandable that the constant media coverage is starting to draw some backlash.

But the measles is extremely contagious. Nine times as contagious as Ebola.
Its ironic that countries are begging for a vaccine for the deadly Ebola virus and here we have a vaccine for the deadly measles virus. But we have the first-world luxury of saying Nah, Ill pass.
So, its human nature to wonder why parents would say No. Of course, the overarching theme is fear of Autism.
But on Thursday, the Autism Speaks foundation issued this statement:
The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause Autism. We urge that all children be fully vaccinated.
The world leader in Autism research and outreach doesnt even believe theres a link between vaccinations and Autism.
Maybe theres another very basic reason more and more parents are opting out: doctors.
Dr. Doug Opel, a pediatrician at Seattle Childrens and assistant professor at the University of Washington, filmed parents during their kids checkups. He thought maybe he could figure out what happens during the visit that tips a parent over to the side of opting out.
Read: Dr. Opels study on parents reactions to vaccines
My perspective is, having had this conversation with many parents, is that theyre just trying to do whats best for their child. I mean, these are good parents. Theyre not crazy parents, theyre not irrational parents. This is a complex decision for parents to make. There is a lot of information about this, its fraught with emotion, you know, as a parent myself I can understand that. So I dont fault parents for coming in with questions, said Opel.
In watching the interactions between pediatricians and parents that were on video, Opel found that doctors use only two approaches to vaccines. The first, is the straight forward, Okay, mom and dad, were going to give your child vaccines today in which parents were more likely to go along.
Then, there was the participatory approach such as: Okay, mom and dad, what do you want to do about vaccines? Opel found that a parent who is already hesitant regarding vaccines is more likely to resist this approach. But, Opel said in this scenario parents can be convinced otherwise.
I think the more likely scenario is a parent who is on the fence who hasnt committed, has some concerns but wants to talk about it. (They) want to be reassured and want to be convinced. As providers, since theyre coming to us wanting to trust us and get information from us, we need to know how to communicate that information effectively, said Opel.
The vaccine debate is now officially in the territory of us and them. Which is the divisive parenting battle line that does more harm than good.
We have calls for anti-vaccine parents to be jailed, sued, or worse, to wear an arm band identifying themselves.
Here we have a doctor, who watched parent after parent turn away potentially life-saving vaccines and hes telling us to have the conversation and be patient with each other.
This is not a new issue, Opel said. I mean, its manifesting in this contemporary way with the measles outbreak, but the underlying tension is an age-old tension, and that is respect for personal choice, personal autonomy and promoting public health and the common good.",21,40,18.15,0,0.5726818971526928,0.3356919483368237,0.18697256101738838,0.18405172453513222,0.125,0.3454489162816042,0.32142745696144587,0.20981202508512609,0.24833146500430245,0.24958231613285595,0.21921826096881686,0.13707684458543856,0.16335616353423169,0.08737088211202056,0.7353027267724713,0.14765255424926185,0.10447619588597637,0.8845918475891937,0.17845190152736803,0.1613458126393938,1.3617279557318065,0.2747893696037341,0.16442757134303573,1.3700090654299129,0.2775226693293288,0.009615384615384616,0.009259259259259259,0.01282051282051282,0.03635183382018825,3.1433498252816237,3.5719954851389377,0,0,1.1710189354024971,6.684802864515502,9.188200665333785,0.4979767152833586,0.29961684898498986,-0.8498003960477335,,-0.4934103540006288,-0.6556181762946701,-0.4085235130890914,-0.4130796575692227,-0.28721583165316694,-0.9771875154758147,-1.3508383185153416,-0.2749380062143269,-0.796628053984462,0.9265631738620765,1.1637898003954859,0.0838333319187235,-0.23974113385735338,-0.19467756414340032,-0.18099585737745175,-0.18720391876478143,-0.8607800525169669,-0.8811489991253795,-0.8466623422012587,0.4124470342508767,0.5349462475737574,0.6419398992592337,0.8995981368238578,0.7546994469688643,1.0541741744740272,-0.671125320465752,-0.7601528529482947,-0.7471854385609863,-0.04277705793313957,-0.10975687318341601,0.14446388100683857,,,0.48100086364672134,0.38661651032111394,-0.4243859331185835,0,-0.09014464788868037
75,yes_142.txt,"Mom loses son to vaccine-preventable disease
SEATTLE, Wash. -- As the measles outbreak prompts renewed debate about the importance of vaccine requirements for children, one Seattle mom is sharing her story of losing her first born son to a now vaccine-preventable disease.
For Linda Dahlstrom-Anderson, the debate about whether to vaccinate children has little do with ideology, politics or religion and a lot to do with true and utter heartbreak.
""He was incredibly joyful and sparkly and curious, and was just about to crawl at the point he died,"" said Dahlstrom-Anderson, remembering her first born, Phoenix.
He came into this world December 3, 2004, and died just over seven months later, killed by a disease so powerful, Phoenix died only hours after his mother learned he was sick.
""I just thought, how is it possible? We just had him. He was just here and so alive and so vital,"" Dahlstrom-Anderson said.
Phoenix died from Strain B of Neisseria meningitidis, a strain of the disease without a vaccine at the time.
""It blows up everything you think you know about the world,"" Dahlstrom-Anderson said. ""I spent a very long time trying to blame myself. I really spent a long time trying to make sense of it.""
Just over three months ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Trumenba, the first vaccine for the strain of meningitidis that killed Phoenix. It's approved for individuals 10 through 25 years of age.
As soon as Dahlstrom-Anderson's second born, Gabriel, is old enough, he'll get the vaccine. Right now, he is only eight.
""Since it keeps us safe, I just think it's really good for us,"" Gabriel Anderson said.
For most kids, a shot is nothing more than a painful prick. That's not so for Gabriel.
""He understands the reason because it is very real for our family in a way that it's not for a lot of people,"" Dahlstrom-Anderson said.
Today, Dahlstrom-Anderson tries to teach Gabriel about his big brother through stories.
She let us in on a moment she showed Gabriel the small box of items bound by a string that they left the hospital with after Phoenix died.
""That was his hand print,"" Dahlstrom-Anderson said, picking up a piece of heavy paper with a marking on it.
""Wow, that was his hand print?"" Gabriel asked.
Gabriel knows his brother well through stories.
""I know that his feet were really big, like probably like this,"" Gabriel said, showing us where Phoenix's feet would have compared to his own.
Gabriel said he wishes he had his brother to play with and go to school with.
""I see all these brothers and sisters together, and I kind of feel sad that I don't have a brother,"" Gabriel said.
Dahlstrom-Anderson wishes her son hadn't died. Nowadays, the moments she gets reading a bedtime story to Gabriel have heightened meaning.
""Appreciating the moment and the people in your life,"" Dahlstrom-Anderson said. ""I think with our son, Gabriel, I have such joy that he is here.""
Dahlstrom-Anderson hopes her pain will spare other parents and convince them certain things, like getting vaccinated, aren't worth letting go.

76,yes_143.txt,"Required vaccination brings red flag
I know of a lot of people who are very vocal against vaccinations. They have their reasons, although I am less than convinced. I rarely believe in one size fits all solutions. This can make me unpopular with both sides.
I would say I am generally in favor of vaccinations the ones that work, anyway. And, the ones where the targeted disease is actually worse than the potential harm caused by the vaccine.
Not all vaccines are equally effective, not all diseases to be vaccinated against are equally dangerous, and vaccines can and do cause harm.
Until vaccines are as safe as say, marijuana, calling them safe as a blanket statement is just plain false, said libertarian activist Christopher Cantwell
A couple of years ago I had a tetanus booster shot. To me the risks associated with tetanus even considering the tiny likelihood of contracting it are great enough that the risk of taking the vaccine wasnt even an issue. Others might disagree.
As long as you go into it understanding the risks and benefits, I wont criticize your choice.
To me, the red flag is mandatory vaccinations; something I am very much opposed to and will never support. I might try to talk you into a particular vaccination, but if you refuse I wont try to force you. If youre sick Ill probably avoid contact just as I generally do with sick people.
If I am vaccinated against whatever you contracted, either my vaccination will protect me, or a vaccination probably wouldnt have done you any good, either. If there is any added risk to me, I am willing to accept it while standing up for your liberty. The risk is small compared to the risk of starting down the slippery slope of believing anyone has the authority to force someone to take a drug they dont want for their own good. Ive seen where that inevitably leads, and it isnt healthy for anyone.
Once you start forcing people to be stabbed and have foreign substances placed inside their body for the good of society, it is a small step to say they must give up other parts of their life, liberty, and property for societys benefit. Maybe their car is too big, their house too garish, their bank account too large, or their yard too messy. The notion that other people do not belong to you has become a very radical position, but it is still the only right one.
If you have strong feelings one way or the other about vaccinations, try to convince people and then leave them alone to live with the consequences of their choice.

77,yes_144.txt,"California Whooping-Cough Outbreak Raises Vaccine Concerns
A California city with a large number of whooping cough cases despite a high immunization rate is revealing the limitations of the current vaccine used to protect against the disease, a newspaper reported.
Elk Grove had a whooping-cough infection rate three to five times higher than other places in Sacramento County last year even though only 80 of the suburb's 4,500 kindergartners opted out of vaccinations, according to the Sacramento Bee.
""Children who were vaccinated did not receive the protection desired,"" said Kate McAuley, program coordinator of communicable disease and immunization at the Sacramento County Public Health Department.
Experts say the whooping cough vaccine introduced in the late 1990s provides less protection each year after it is administered, often leaving children vulnerable before they get their booster shot, the Bee reported.
The new vaccine uses only pieces of the bacteria that cause whooping cough, or pertussis, as opposed to whole, dead bacteria. The change was made after some children who took the earlier vaccine experienced reactions including a high fever and seizures.
But the new vaccine loses its effectiveness after its first year, according to experts and a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Concerns about the vaccine come as a record-high 11,000 Californians caught whooping cough in 2014 and a measles outbreak sweeps the state. Parents of unvaccinated children have been blamed for the measles outbreak, but experts say pertussis is different.
""It's not correct to only pin (the pertussis outbreak) on the people who are unvaccinated,"" Mark Sawyer, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego, and a member of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's immunization practices committee, told the Bee. ""The effectiveness of the vaccine is a huge part of this. People who are immunized do still get pertussis.""
Still, Sawyer and other experts said parents should vaccinate their children against whooping cough because the vaccine reduces the chances of infection. Pertussis symptoms of which include fever, vomiting, fatigue and a severe cough that forces people to take deep breaths that result in a ""whooping"" sound can be fatal.
And they encourage adults to get a pertussis booster shot if it has been more than a decade since their last shot, or they spend time around infants.
""People shouldn't avoid this vaccine for any reason,"" Sawyer said.",12,17,26.764705882352942,0,0.7985142357647419,0.5630891521406525,0.17242815097173056,0.17543507450156742,0.11764705882352941,0.32271779387277394,0.35686936685330883,0.13622161207927597,0.3002482586301907,0.17575298785232008,0.19329136892199694,0.06024553439217723,0.1443192921113223,0.04944548504871765,0.43009138896470717,0.08473136200987501,0.14142343120550338,1.2229973475097997,0.24470802251033877,0.1534274171448473,1.32065247112504,0.26245610204588504,0.15496430682229873,1.321765403992079,0.2645975672202396,0.006944444444444444,0.011904761904761904,0.041666666666666664,0.047619047619047616,3.2437515291070627,3.618583896643374,0,0,1.1572857940644612,6.667492174144369,9.668467030955528,-0.4111584063688258,-0.6940462004547078,0.8604921769028342,,1.4270187534032306,1.1488441081139416,-0.5401978575836066,-0.49243731340062535,-0.3163402536221331,-1.572249380980401,-0.20961386850139818,-0.9705772975863948,0.03236329068556543,-1.4730268774477315,-0.15311899286049382,-1.2253939711488693,-0.7259317121631756,-1.1037020266730546,-1.0765803313090667,-1.1005516494547296,0.6801921925614091,0.8462989428566879,0.8274927620532901,-0.42643107648709877,-0.28919382271704996,-0.4145651214714152,-0.39665019373834404,-0.31712027399291043,-0.31373594343124306,-0.7597778314449055,-0.6712884382738266,0.13340147112879755,0.5757600456261615,1.3136418500653706,0.9099282295297597,,,0.1987111616585419,0.3304404962922998,1.2574582301217057,0,-8.120740529662397
78,yes_145.txt,"Mercury News editorial: Disneylands measles is a hard lesson in how vaccines work
The Disneyland measles outbreak shows that when it comes to contagious diseases, as the Los Angeles Times aptly noted, it's a small world after all.
Measles is one of the most infectious and dangerous diseases known to man. Before the introduction of the measles vaccine, about 500,000 Americans got it every year, with thousands hospitalized and nearly 500 deaths. The Centers for Disease Control calls vaccination for this and other deadly diseases one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.
The growing anti-vaccination movement is one of the most frustrating developments of this decade. Some of the parents who mistrust vaccine are uneducated and have no access to pediatric counsel, but there's no excuse for the irresponsible parents who have access to the latest science yet irrationally fear that vaccines are not safe for their children.
Scientists say a 90 percent immunization rate is the minimum necessary to prevent a disease outbreak. Santa Clara County is fortunate that its vaccination rate is 92.53 percent. Contra Costa County's is even higher at 93.96 percent. But in Orange County, the home of Disneyland, the county's overall rate of vaccination has fallen below 90 percent and continues to decline.
""You should vaccinate your children to protect them,"" said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County's health officer. ""But you also vaccinate to protect your neighbor, the other children in your school and in your community. There are some who can't be vaccinated, chief among them infants who don't get their first measles shot until 12-15 months. You vaccinate because it's a community benefit.""
Cody, like health experts everywhere, says parental fears that vaccinations are dangerous are misguided.
The myth that measles vaccinations have been linked to autism largely stemmed from a study published in the British medical journal Lancet in 2008. The study was proved to be flawed, and Lancet issued a retraction in 2010. The magazine Pediatrics in 2014 published a review by experts at UCLA, Boston Children's Hospital and Rand Corp. of more than 60 scientific medical studies of vaccine safety. They concluded that problems are ""extremely rare"" and strongly encouraged parents to vaccinate their children.
A total of 73 people in six states have contracted measles because of the Disneyland outbreak, and three businesses in Gilroy have posted warnings after discovering that a man with measles had visited their stores. The virus is spreading rapidly because it can stay in the air for up to two hours after an infected person sneezes, coughs or talks. Of course, if everybody around the victim was vaccinated, the virus would expire.
Vaccination is the cornerstone of protecting communities and preventing the return of diseases that once killed hundreds of Americans every year. We can only hope this winter's hard lesson doesn't prove fatal.",10,25,21.64,0,0.6030683244268099,0.38616163994806507,0.32537989467382433,0.3162377340098222,0.24,0.42981617376208303,0.3782824842825386,0.3317115176546698,0.3183812560260425,0.2187258304655552,0.16770088920442788,0.19920572958783142,0.2001503786359192,0.17222402892030558,1.1627476209154082,0.25380454304997024,0.14199903323165627,1.1010147997731887,0.22828364078644559,0.15038902461484052,1.305259524408066,0.2589169165539372,0.16060753946982592,1.3294436804618253,0.26828167919067325,0.0954861111111111,0.03166666666666667,0.02,0.02980392156862745,3.2116558726491373,3.60891235768039,0,0,1.1291940554979467,6.795849292471964,9.55461537504943,-0.6131884334026445,-0.3484242702148129,-0.15692461350654394,,-0.2350107830362978,-0.25512664212090924,0.8445142433571234,0.8043275487994879,0.16829012794146359,1.231402835713228,0.4798854625396522,0.8773598701809442,0.32190539920648775,-0.07632981934370102,-1.4529403406274366,1.1425271424196095,0.6999616314337048,1.8391465258879889,1.0732596804586618,1.3536708585357924,0.7041990428396951,0.2236184571826222,0.41248261522703367,-0.7483196443172733,-0.5980384854339402,-0.717742460647867,0.3763421370056286,-0.14653355030744689,0.07616689813379413,2.17905290751403,-0.007471260655549326,-0.5280171410381956,-0.4022383010357504,0.8586205238987195,0.7510213676632703,,,-0.37872471503398913,0.7469802832838915,0.8587612638808461,0,1.4619891634749536
79,yes_146.txt,"Scolding Anti-Vaxxers Won't Change Their Minds
If you want to change someone's beliefs, compassion and empathy work infinitely better than humiliation. In the race to form an opinion, feelings always beat logic. So while it's tempting to snap at anti-vaxxers about how complications due to vaccines are statistically insignificant, an aggressive approach towards non-believers will fall on deaf ears.
Many Canadians fist-pumped when they heard CBC host Anna Maria Tremonti eviscerate an anti-vaxxer on Monday's The Current.
Darlene Tindall, a 39-year-old Sudbury mom, yoga instructor and energy medicine practitioner was a prime target for ridicule. In a soothing voice, she spoke about chakras, anecdotal evidence that vaccines leave children ""vegetated"" and about feeling bullied by the pro-vaccine side.
""Why is it bullying when someone tells you truth?"" asked Tremonti in an icy voice. ""You're entitled to opinion but you're not entitled to facts.""
Boom. It's a sentiment many of us who trust science want to scream amid the current outbreak of measles in Ontario and Quebec. But we should restrain ourselves. If you want to change someone's beliefs, compassion and empathy work infinitely better than humiliation.
In the race to form an opinion, feelings always beat logic. So while it's tempting to snap at anti-vaxxers about how complications due to vaccines are statistically insignificant, an aggressive approach towards non-believers will fall on deaf ears. In fact, citing science can actually strengthen an anti-vaxxer's resolve. ""Motivated reasoning"" is a social psychology phenomenon where people discredit facts that don't fit with their beliefs and cling to information that reinforces them. It's why some people ignore clues that their partners are being unfaithful. It's why others deny evidence of climate change, the truth about 9/11 and that Obama was born in Hawaii.
If you want to convert someone with different beliefs, find common ground. That's how Tremonti's other guest, Mallory Olsheski, approached vaccine skeptic Darlene Tindall during the same segment. Olsheski, a mother of four, has good reason to put up a fight. Her three-year-old son recently had a heart transplant and can't be vaccinated due to complications. He relies on other children's immunizations to shield him from disease. But instead of aggression, Olsheski used empathy to sweeten her scientific arguments.
""I try very hard to hear your side,"" she told Tindall. ""I'm empathetic with your situation. I believe you love your children we all love our children that's undeniable.""
Instantly, Tindall's shield came down: ""I guarantee you I will go back and will look at the science and I really do take into consideration families like Mallory's.""
When I asked Tindall later why her tone softened, she said: ""We're both moms and as far as I can see we both share the same desires for our children."" Both moms.
Humans are more receptive to arguments when they feel understood. ""We know social cues are important and hearing from other people who are like you can be powerful,"" says Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College, ""Especially when the communication is respectful."" He describes how during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, foreign medical teams were most successful in spreading awareness about disease prevention through trusted community leaders. A study from Yale Law School shows that conservative Republicans were more inclined to believed an article about climate change when the headline read ""Scientific Panel Recommends Nuclear Solution to Global Warming"" instead of ""Scientific Panel Recommends Anti-Pollution Solution to Global Warming."" The researcher concluded the former appealed to a pro-industry view. If you want people to eat facts, serve them with like-minded values.
Perhaps the most extreme example of persuasion through empathy is the story of Daryl Davis, a black musician who embedded himself in the Maryland Ku Klux Klan to write a book about the cult. As he befriended members in the 1990s, they started changing their minds about racism. Davis told the CBC he now has up to 18 white hoods in his closet from departed Klan members.
When people's beliefs contradict science, there's an obvious temptation to cut them down. But we should be more careful with how we deliver our arguments. On a policy level, messaging should come from people that communities trust, such as doctors or religious leaders. At the dinner table or on Facebook, try a little empathy. It will help the medicine go down and the immunization rates go up.",14,46,19.195652173913043,0,0.4342092661807934,0.2346411488666244,0.21927226075148654,0.21672916329421457,0.1956521739130435,0.43181317783508105,0.43067949659094273,0.39730163907645166,0.44384062809070607,0.2660999121624477,0.20953958228537325,0.19631194277964015,0.23938903452668917,0.12406800259976482,1.0827118612252438,0.21691651750484855,0.15209556174531905,1.3058611206295918,0.2644709127643523,0.15633666401285964,1.3183524322507798,0.2643087025569981,0.15217790234523282,1.311204170638391,0.26103043309156504,0.012499999999999999,0.024046285180738963,0.07216494845360824,0.023353671365453396,3.122870188703773,3.576584754895243,0,0,1.1448114543284997,6.169513150161478,9.209066596317413,-0.20912837933500703,0.558833296664911,-0.6422052475474767,,-1.670951501258803,-1.4574853646467996,-0.11610589171387628,-0.11212685939434328,-0.00736812490788349,1.2836809831678753,2.167061795205657,1.4973735883160644,2.3252019490435107,1.4634156690325109,0.6721791190107321,1.093216194981502,1.702093986885682,0.684906640923127,0.8384100046481924,0.8182138332923996,1.1252987564351518,1.269291046632297,1.3268601126122386,-0.11822425378048233,-0.33534188932299214,-0.2558657555314061,-0.7783231506500917,-0.5517570708029637,-0.6912585985991064,-0.5753806086082665,-0.2634455805052485,1.0644229117286492,-0.7563381831475082,-0.40009744955644355,0.21986723284406123,,,-0.05770341676066482,-1.2855826684434053,-0.35131555645383544,0,4.4588874196172075
80,yes_147.txt,"President Obama To Anti-Vaccination Movement: 'Get Your Kids Vaccinated'
President Obama is speaking out against the anti-vaccination movement, saying there is no science to support the beliefs of so-called ""anti-vaxxers"" and calling on them to better protect their children.
Obama is speaking out amid a new outbreak of the measles, a disease once nearly eradicated but has returned thanks in part to a movement that opposes getting children vaccinated.
""There is every reason to get vaccinated there aren't reasons to not,"" Obama said in an interview with NBC News. ""I just want people to know the facts and science and the information. And the fact is that a major success of our civilization is our ability to prevent disease that in the past have devastated folks. And measles is preventable.""
The latest measles outbreak is believed to have been sparked when a number of unvaccinated people visited the Disneyland theme park in California. It has since spread to 14 other states, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden warned that it has the potential to become a ""very large"" outbreak.
Obama's remarks represent the White House's most direct and strongest statements against the anti-vaccination movement. Over the weekend, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the decision on whether to vaccinate or not was ultimately up to parents.
""I'm not going stand up here and dispense medical advice. But I am going to suggest that the president's view is that people should evaluate this for themselves, with a bias toward good science and toward the advice of our public health professionals, who are trained to offer us exactly this kind of advice.""
But Obama took it a step further, saying that parents should be vaccinating their kids.
""You should get your kids vaccinated it's good for them,"" Obama said. ""We should be able to get back to the point where measles effectively is not existing in this country.""
President Obama is not the only one countering the anti-vaccination movement. Many doctors have begun refusing patients who are not vaccinated, and school districts are removing children who do not have their vaccinations.",10,18,23.055555555555557,0,0.6827604893375846,0.48576726477130566,0.2798090269168218,0.2796817163626353,0.0,0.3591397672891617,0.36519120032442554,0.25291842317039315,0.3580694977619818,0.19719201929867267,0.2166640593064036,0.1502652474796644,0.20079404877188306,0.10278287324494233,0.8647931911113942,0.17419072781292486,0.14747571345412216,1.2815521655497604,0.255232776543154,0.1477016157522945,1.2824552083394165,0.255086846559185,0.16540140225220784,1.3343845636635518,0.27376992159266494,0.02121212121212121,0.02023809523809524,0.02,0.0596078431372549,3.1199561209648876,3.561642430966379,0,0,1.1153116531165312,6.1041448163399386,8.940311276208174,-0.6131884334026445,-0.6508434591747209,0.12410809803674662,,0.44267406080525956,0.5352726693127767,0.4319492702084889,0.46765380021833924,-0.7823310051255915,-0.6187844769290806,0.05834798386940755,0.13254040018153945,0.9556349997159321,-0.7762186067168089,1.034053824987911,0.3085674554100934,0.7164005907926387,0.17472863963955615,0.1989692193366305,0.19801733560704735,0.9326170055100789,1.1452018860417,1.0934315224825346,-1.0330248564963989,-1.0555851419779418,-1.0458378465807117,1.0329904442562516,-0.03676294217474278,0.6570073625137068,-0.2862122364326279,-0.39136553204925184,-0.5280171410381956,1.2339098763986431,-0.44141029725673114,-0.025640520742629937,,,-0.6640825319142329,-1.4977135747833756,-1.2924694635785696,0,1.1920154897411543
81,yes_149.txt,"Vaccination debate needs a heavy dose of reasoned thought: Opinion
Miami Children's Hospital pediatrician Dr. Amanda Porro, M.D administers a measles vaccination to Sophie Barquin, 4, as her mother Gabrielle Barquin holds her during a visit to the Miami Children's Hospital on Jan. 28, in Miami, Florida. A recent outbreak of measles has some doctors encouraging vaccination as the best way to prevent measles and its spread.
As if we don't have enough to worry about, measles epidemics are on the rise. This is not the result of bad hygiene, or a breakdown in the healthcare system, but from parents intentionally choosing not to vaccinate their children. Why would a parent not want his child protected from infectious diseases? Some feel vaccinations cause autism, while others see vaccinations as part of some government conspiracy. It brings to mind that old saw, ""don't cut off your nose to spite your face."" But it seems a lot of noses are being sliced over this issue.
Vaccination came about in the late 1790s when English doctor Edward Jenner sought a way to combat the horrifying and fatal scourge of small pox. Because he used a cow as part of his experiments he called his technique, vaccination, from the Latin word for cow. Vaccination proved extremely good at preventing disease. By the 20th century maladies such as small pox, polio, and measles had been effectively eradicated in the industrialized world. Until now, that is.
In a 1998 paper in the medical journal Lancet researcher Andrew Wakefield claimed that childhood inoculations were linked to autism. The autism support community, already suspicious of vaccines, used this article as a clarion call to stop immunizing children. That call was heeded by a number of affluent, middle-class parents, and the modern anti-vaccination movement took off. Unfortunately, Wakefield's work was not embraced by the medical field. They quickly pointed out a number of disturbing flaws in his methodology and results. The Lancet retracted his paper and he lost his license. A number of follow-up studies have shown that vaccinations have no connection to autism. But that only spurred anti-vaccination proponents to greater effort.
Along with the much discussed outbreak of measles at Disneyland in California, there have been other less publicized outbreaks across the country linked to the refusal to vaccinate. If we continue this way, measles will only be the first. Whooping cough has begun to reappear, and others will likely follow as the nation's 'herd immunity' decreases. You may have the right to not vaccinate your child, but do you have the right to put your neighbor's child at risk? Deciding not to have your children inoculated may be a lifestyle choice, but it's a poor one.
By way of comparison, measles is more contagious than the dreaded Ebola. Recently pundits fumed because they said the government hadn't done enough to stop the spread of that disease. People cheered when travelers coming to America from Africa were forcibly quarantined for fear they might have Ebola. Yet the idea of inoculating children against measles equates to an outrageous intrusion by Big Brother.
Every year almost 800,000 children worldwide die from measles, small pox, and other diseases because they are not vaccinated. The United Nations works to try to get vaccinations to people in Third World countries where disease ravages the population. Desperate parents walk miles to get the chance of having their kids vaccinated. They understand the importance of this.
Those kinds of numbers haven't hit the United States because we have -- or at least had -- very high rates of immunization. That could change. Elected officials and social commentators should be at the forefront of promoting universal immunization, as they once were, not denigrating it as some do now. This is not a political issue; it's a public health issue.
Vaccinations are one of the great advances in medical history. Government programs promoting public health have benefited us all, reduced the infant mortality rate, and saved us huge amounts of suffering and tax dollars. Don't throw that away because of flawed belief, or fear, or simple selfishness. Why not keep your nose instead of cutting it off? All of our faces will thank you for it.

82,yes_15.txt,"Harold Pollack: Politicians should stand up to dangerous anti-vaccine madness
INTENTIONAL non-vaccination is causing avoidable public health disasters in the United States. The problem is particularly acute for measles - though similar things might be said for flu and other diseases - because measles is so efficiently transmitted from one susceptible person to another.
Measles herd immunity requires more than 90 percent of Americans to be immunized. This daunting number may understate the challenge, since small communities that are ambivalent about immunization provide local pockets of vulnerability within which local outbreaks can take hold and spread.
It's all-too-easy to see how these issues could become enmeshed in the culture wars, partisan politics or even the 2016 presidential campaign. This would be a public health disaster. We will never sustain herd immunity if Americans' beliefs and behaviors in the realm of vaccination harden along cultural or religious or ideological lines.
Ambivalence about vaccines crosses conventional political boundaries. People of varying backgrounds and views find powerful reasons to doubt medical and public health authority, to distrust Big Pharma. These doubts and distrust don't come from nowhere, and are deeply held - which is why so many pro-vaccination messages often fall short. Many others simply wish to free-ride on the herd immunity provided by others.
We must continue to debunk false rumors about vaccines - most prominently the debunked theories that the MMR vaccine causes autism. We must recognize, however, that providing and repeating credible medical information only accomplishes so much. The required information has been out there for many years, available in two minutes to anyone with access to Google.
It's not just the message that matters. To reach the people we most need to persuade, the messenger matters, too. There is and long has been ample evidence for the safety of common vaccines. Repeating this message only accomplishes so much with intentional non-vaccinators.
So here's what President Barack Obama, Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Majority Leader McConnell, Gov. Mitt Romney, Sen. Bernie Sanders, House Speaker Boehner, Sen. Rand Paul, Dr. Ben Carson, Gov. Bobby Jindal, Sen. John McCain and others should do.
They should get together on the White House lawn. Maybe better yet, we need one of those YouTube viral videos.
In whatever form, our political leaders must dramatically convey a simple, utterly nonpartisan message that cuts through the clutter to makes five points:
1. We have many deep divisions over every political issue you can imagine. We have no disagreement on the basic issues of vaccination.
2. We are vaccinated ourselves, and we have vaccinated our children.
3. Vaccines are safe and effective. They can protect you and your family against measles, flu, and other preventable diseases.
4. Vaccines are essential to protect our loved-ones, friends, and neighbors who often can't be immunized and who are especially vulnerable to these diseases. Some are cancer patients. Others have diseases of their immune systems. Still others are infants or seniors who can die of these readily preventable diseases.
5. Each of them is counting on us to do our part. Each of us has a responsibility to protect our communities against measles, flu, etc.
Such display of social and political consensus won't reach everyone. States should revisit some relatively lax exemption policies in light of disease outbreaks. I'm sure other policy changes would be useful, too.
Still, a bipartisan campaign of goodwill can help, too. It's not just the message. The messengers matter, too. Some issues are larger than partisan politics. This is one.

83,yes_150.txt,"Red-Blue America: Should Americans be required to get vaccinated?
This one should be easy. Vaccinations protect individuals and whole communities from debilitating or deadly diseases. People who refuse to vaccinate their kids for fear of them developing autism or suffering some other remote harm would put their childrens lives and the lives of other children in jeopardy for a folly.
But its a free country, more or less. And its a divided country, as the coverage of presidential candidates trying to pander to everyone on the vaccination question certainly shows.
Would-be Republican presidential candidates find themselves in an impossible position. No political candidate can truly speak his mind anymore, if he ever could. A question as seemingly straightforward as whether parents should immunize their kids against preventable illnesses ends up being a clumsy exercise of on-the-one-hand, and-on-the-other...
At the same time, no Republican presidential candidate worthy of serious consideration would endorse the outlandish idea of jailing parents for refusing to vaccinate their kids, as a USA Today columnist argued last month. No Democrat would take that position, either. The idea should be offensive to Americans who at least profess to value individual liberty, regardless of party.
But what about mandatory vaccinations with penalties and consequences short of jail? Thats a policy debate worth having.
Mandatory vaccinations arent unheard of in the United States. Massachusetts in 1809 passed the nations first law requiring every citizen to be vaccinated for smallpox.
What if instead of the government applying direct pressure on people to vaccinate, the law made life too inconvenient for people not to vaccinate? For example, lawmakers could tweak public accommodation laws to let businesses discriminate on the basis of vaccination.
It would be inconvenient, of course. Anti-vax parents would howl with indignation. But personal choices often have broad consequences. And their indignation should not trump the public health.

Flashback: Galileo is under house arrest pondering the unyielding ignorance of The Church for refusing to consider his heliocentric proposition that the Earth circled the sun.
We find this historical anecdote preposterous today, but people were persecuted for lesser heresies in Galileos time. Though we are now centuries removed from such dim-wittery, we find ourselves in a not-dissimilar pickle.
After decades free of many crippling and deadly diseases thanks to the miracle of vaccines, some people are skeptical. Parents fearful of side effects, often on account of anecdotal evidence or discredited studies, are reluctant to vaccinate their children.
Marin County, Calif., a liberal enclave famous for its beauty and wealth, seems to be the epicenter of the debate. Many have opted out of vaccinations as part of their evolution into honeybees. Some see vaccines as a conspiracy of Big Pharma. Elsewhere, especially in the South, people are simply distrustful of authority, especially government.
The latter group is familiarly known as the GOP base. They tend to be litmus-test conservatives on social issues and place Scripture above science.
On the bright side, the far left and the far right finally have found common ground. Theyd rather let their children risk illness and their country an epidemic than contaminate their offsprings pristine bodies with antibodies.
Oh, to be a fly at that picnic!
One wonders what public tortures Jonas Salk might have encountered had he presented his polio vaccine today rather than in the 1950s. One crucial difference is that polio left visual reminders of its assault on the human body. The 1952 epidemic affected nearly 58,000 people, more than 3,100 of whom died and some 21,000 were left disabled.
Most Americans under the age of 50, including doctors, have never seen measles. Now, after decades of being a virtually measles-free nation, we have 100 cases spread across at least 14 states and the potential for more as stubborn purists resist common sense. Science and experience overwhelmingly support vaccines, and the single study to the contrary, suggesting a connection to autism, has been thoroughly discredited.
Naturally, into this tar pit, the GOP presidential field has fallen. Or rather, been pushed. Asked about the vaccine controversy, both New Jersey Gov.Chris Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul have handed the media a fresh bone to gnaw.
Christie initially said that parents need to have some measure of choice, though he later clarified by saying that children should be vaccinated against measles. Paul told radio host Laura Ingraham, While I think its a good idea to take the vaccine, I think thats a personal decision for individuals.
Neither comment standing alone is objectionable. Barring a time-release patch from God, vaccines are the best weve got. Eventually, most parents come around to this conclusion, despite reluctance to inject their children with a tiny dose of the virus. They do it because the alternative is unthinkable.
The CDC is urging people to get vaccinated for measles amid an outbreak that began at Disneyland and has now spread to other states, including Utah, Washington, Oregon and Colorado.
While parents rights should always be protected in the absence of harm to their children, the public health of the nation also has to be protected. Individual rights are justifiably modified when the exercise of those rights adversely affects others. Smoking is a textbook example of this premise.
Preserving individual freedom is one of the compelling forces of modern conservatism and remains its most attractive feature. Thus, Republican candidates are faced with a daunting balancing act of confirming to primary voters their allegiance to the principle while also signaling to the rest of the country that theyre not that foolish.
These conundrums are not new. The conflict between individual rights and the greater good is the fundamental argument in a democracy, the success of which relies upon an educated rather than only radio-informed citizenry, as well as leaders willing to defend science over ideology.
Aspiring presidents would do well to articulate these conflicts with compassion, without condescension or pandering while explaining why, in this case, vaccines are the right choice. For starters they might quote Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:
Study after study has shown that there are no negative long-term consequences. ... And the more kids who are not vaccinated, the more theyre at risk and the more they put their neighbors kids at risk as well.
There. That didnt hurt much, did it?

85,yes_152.txt,"Don't Believe In Vaccinations? Read Roald Dahl's Heartfelt Letter On Measles After His Daughter Died
In 1962, Roald Dahl's eldest daughter, Olivia, died from measles at the age of seven.
More than 20 years later the author, best known for works such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda, wrote a poignant letter calling for all children to be vaccinated against the illness.
Dahl's letter was originally published in a pamphlet by the Sandwell Health Authority in the 1980s.
Now, as America struggles with a measles outbreak in several states, Dahl's heartfelt words are receiving attention again:
Measles: A Dangerous Illness
Olivia, my eldest daughter, caught measles when she was seven years old. As the illness took its usual course I can remember reading to her often in bed and not feeling particularly alarmed about it.
Then one morning, when she was well on the road to recovery, I was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldnt do anything.
Are you feeling all right? I asked her.
I feel all sleepy, she said.
In an hour, she was unconscious. In 12 hours she was dead.
The measles had turned into a terrible thing called measles encephalitis and there was nothing the doctors could do to save her.
That was 24 years ago in 1962, but even now, if a child with measles happens to develop the same deadly reaction from measles as Olivia did, there would still be nothing the doctors could do to help her.
On the other hand, there is today something that parents can do to make sure that this sort of tragedy does not happen to a child of theirs. They can insist that their child is immunised against measles.
I was unable to do that for Olivia in 1962 because in those days a reliable measles vaccine had not been discovered. Today a good and safe vaccine is available to every family and all you have to do is to ask your doctor to administer it.
It is not yet generally accepted that measles can be a dangerous illness. Believe me, it is. In my opinion parents who now refuse to have their children immunised are putting the lives of those children at risk.
In America, where measles immunisation is compulsory, measles like smallpox, has been virtually wiped out.
Here in Britain, because so many parents refuse, either out of obstinacy or ignorance or fear, to allow their children to be immunised, we still have a hundred thousand cases of measles every year.
Out of those, more than 10,000 will suffer side effects of one kind or another. At least 10,000 will develop ear or chest infections. About 20 will die.
LET THAT SINK IN.
Every year around 20 children will die in Britain from measles.
So what about the risks that your children will run from being immunised?
They are almost non-existent. Listen to this. In a district of around 300,000 people, there will be only one child every 250 years who will develop serious side effects from measles immunisation! That is about a million to one chance.
I should think there would be more chance of your child choking to death on a chocolate bar than of becoming seriously ill from a measles immunisation.
So what on earth are you worrying about? It really is almost a crime to allow your child to go unimmunised.
The ideal time to have it done is at 13 months, but it is never too late. All school-children who have not yet had a measles immunisation should beg their parents to arrange for them to have one as soon as possible.
Incidentally, I dedicated two of my books to Olivia, the first was James and the Giant Peach. That was when she was still alive. The second was The BFG, dedicated to her memory after she had died from measles.
You will see her name at the beginning of each of these books. And I know how happy she would be if only she could know that her death had helped to save a good deal of illness and death among other children.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are currently at least 102 reported cases of measles in 14 states in the US.
A few years ago, the UK faced a similar situation in Swansea, Wales.
During the measles outbreak, which lasted from November 2012 until July 2013, more than 1,200 people were affected, 88 visited hospital and one person died.
In a pre-Super Bowl interview with NBC on Sunday, President Barack Obama urged American parents to get their children fully vaccinated.

86,yes_153.txt,"Goodnight Measles: Bedtime Stories for Your Unvaccinated Child
The anti-vaccine movement has no problem innoculating kids with propaganda.
As of February 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has counted 121 reported measles cases this year in 17 states and Washington DC. Of those, 103 (85 percent) are linked to the outbreak that began at Disneyland in December. And the cause of this resurgence of a disease that until recently was considered licked in the United States? All evidence points to parents refusing to vaccinate their children.
At least some of those parents, though, are happy to inoculate their children with anti-vaccine sentiment. Theres a whole ouevre of anti-vax fiction for kids, and some of it takes a pretty, well, creative approachzombies! shape-shifting aliens!to advancing ideas about the danger of vaccination. Some of the books include claims about links between vaccines and autism that have been repeatedly and conclusively proven false by science.
Here are a handful of examples, rated on a scale of 1 to 5 syringes (5 being the most explicitly anti-science):
Melanies Marvelous Measles (2012):
Summary: A little girl named Tina learns that her best friend Melanie is out of school with the measles. Melanie is vaccinated, but Tinas parents decided not to vaccinate her after her little brother was very sick from his shots. Tinas mother assures her daughter that measles make the body stronger, and they go to Melanies house so Tina can get the measles, too. Another (vaccinated) classmate ends up catching measles from Melanie, who eventually recovers, but Tina doesnt contract the disease, because she eats lots of fresh, raw food, and also because she plays in the sunshine daily and drinks plenty of water.
Excerpt: Tina heard Jared tell Travis, the boy beside him, that he wouldnt get the measles because he had been vaccinated. Travis said that he wasnt vaccinated, but didnt mind, until Jared then told him angrily, Well, youre going to die if you dont get vaccinated. Travis thought about this for a minute and said to Jared, Well I know that isnt true because I havent had any vaccinations and I am still alive. Jared didnt know what to say to that!
Vaccination: A Zombie Novel (2014):
Summary: The federal government mass-produces a swine flu vaccine that turns recipients into zombies. A 911 dispatcher who has foregone the vaccine must find a way to save himself and his two kids. Escaping to Mexico might be their only chance.
Excerpt: Theyre not dead though. They look it. But theyre not. Their bodies will continue to decay, but theyll keep going, keep coming after you, keep eating until they just cant do it anymore. They get all dumb, and forget how to do things, but not how to eat. They remember that. And how to run. My God, theyre fast. So, so fast.
Who forgets things?
Who? he laughed. All of them. Everyone who got the vaccination.
What vaccination? I asked.
For the flu. Arent you listening to me?
The Vicious Case of the Viral Vaccine (2013): Mae, the daughter of a research nurse, believes the new Universal Flu Vaccine is safe, but her classmate Clinton isnt so sure. As protests against the vaccine heat up, Selectra Volt, Dudette from the Futurea time-travelersends them on a mission to go back in time and see how vaccines were developed. On their journey, they visit the likes of Louis Pasteur and Jonas Salk, creator of the polio vaccine. They must return to the present in time to uncover a plot against the new flu vaccine.
Excerpt: That vaccine could make people really sick, Clinton burst out.
Mae clutched her current events report and looked out at the class. It wont. My mother worked on this vaccine. and its safe. Only crazy people think it isnt.
The Vaccine Aliens (2005):
Summary: A son develops autism after getting the Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine. The father then discovers that in addition to causing autism, the MMR vaccine is part of a plot by shape-shifting aliens to destroy the human race.
Extra: Author Raymond Gallup is the president of the Autism Autoimmunity Project. In 2002, he wrote a letter on the anti-vax site VaccinationNews responding to a Time magazine story headlined The Secrets of Autism. In the letter, he alludes to some of the sinister themes of his book, claiming that the medical community and government health officials avoid the vaccine/autism link of the MMR vaccine.
No Vaccines for Me! (2010):
Summary: This interactive family book is written by Kathleen Dunkelberger, a registered nurse. Its a collection of illustrated stories that go through the history of vaccines, their ingredients, potential dangers and side effects (including autism), government connections to the pharmaceutical industry, and more.
Excerpt: Babies and kids dont always need shots. Many doctors and nurses know this now, but there are still some who will try to give these shots to all people of all ages. They sometimes try to give them to children in school. These shots are called vaccinations (vax-sin-nay-shuns). Vaccinations can be given as a shot, a liquid to take in your mouth, or as a spray mist up your nose.",24,67,15.671641791044776,0,0.5097025769452254,0.21719113104570076,0.24106295481841597,0.2279598810951871,0.11940298507462686,0.41212966398894785,0.34685706246010994,0.3286215279306736,0.22050827364956113,0.24095570155978202,0.19112312842799084,0.18586946272501476,0.13557109351274144,0.12090518960140367,1.0161483022091469,0.2036908086893618,0.09590470637100036,0.8087843187293513,0.16183981366310024,0.16145004533307447,1.3677597096041778,0.2734704807820977,0.16175653128394185,1.367021816892502,0.27320395501568256,0.03592687074829932,0.026164889032536092,0.04504504504504504,0.04617117117117117,3.258018648528405,3.6869187879599044,0,0,1.2156068295064721,6.384207767148037,9.263409367054637,0.8010217558340866,1.4660908635446348,-1.341833170674447,,-1.0289728001687148,-1.5959562802666718,0.08117095542782456,-0.008694152423828278,-0.30938516777879793,0.768400291862666,-0.5320086437650171,0.8481506542770086,-1.2409001902875223,0.6461822061878824,-0.26325078063104357,0.9152733749922963,-0.9493555952839973,0.6090979583899386,0.6430919328733022,0.6262328694315566,-1.2182743907896207,-1.2681213141332748,-1.26641543486174,0.423489489153792,0.6559675844598002,0.5289598917057899,0.5337274365091677,0.6883323471595545,0.5971090808199799,0.2021923744248061,-0.19228009082521286,0.23653327136273622,0.496275860771882,1.51590733755236,2.032695058744614,,,1.3975212014976761,-0.5888636146580027,-0.16101267804929625,0,-2.49420890077611
87,yes_154.txt,"Parents Reportedly Throwing Measles Parties To Infect Their Unvaccinated Kids
Some parents in California are reportedly considering hosting measles parties social gatherings where unvaccinated children can come into contact with infected kids to build up their childrens natural resistance to the infectious disease.
Julie Schiffman, who has chosen not to vaccinate her two children, told KQEDs California Report that she was recently approached by a friend who invited her to a measles party. The friend offered to arrange a play date with a child who currently has measles. Schiffman turned her down.
I would want that to be something they decide on their own, when theyre older and are more capable of assessing the risks and dangers, she said. When theyre teenagers, Id say, okay, you have a choice, you can get vaccinated or you can get the measles, what would you rather?
Before the development of the chicken pox vaccine, this particular natural infection tactic used to be popular among parents who wanted to give their children the virus while they were still young and the infection would be less severe. Now, despite the fact that theres a vaccine available to prevent that disease, the practice has persisted among some parents who are skeptical about following the governments recommended immunization schedule.
The rise of social media has made it easier than ever before for parents to plan so-called pox parties. The Facebook group Lets Have a Chickenpox Party, for instance, helps anti-vaccine parents connect with each other and publicize their pox-related events. In 2011, some adults even started mailing infected lollipops across state lines, something that violates federal law.
The idea has been floated for other diseases, too. When a serious strain of influenza colloquially known as swine flu started spreading in 2009, some people startedsuggesting holding swine flu parties for their kids. The idea was that surviving a milder strain of the virus earlier in the season would protect children from a deadlier strain that could emerge later.
Health experts are strongly opposed to intentionally infecting kids with diseases. I think its totally nuts, Dr. Anne Moscona, a flu specialist at Cornell University, told the New York Times back when reporters started asking her about swine flu parties. This is like the Middle Ages, when people deliberately infected themselves with smallpox. Its vigilante vaccination you know, taking immunity into your own hands.
Now that weve developed safe and effective vaccines to protect kids, doctors say its unnecessary to expose them to diseases in this way. After all, the whole point of vaccination is to build up kids immunity in a controlled and less medically risky way.
Public health officials in California are warning parents against participating in measles parties, particularly since the disease is among the most contagious in the world. In arecent email, the California Department of Public Health said that such a practice unnecessarily places the exposed children at potentially grave risk and could contribute to further spread of the outbreak.
Indeed, the practice can backfire. As Forbes reports, there were some cases in the early 1900s that involved parents intentionally infecting their kids with measles and losing all of them to the disease, which can be particularly dangerous in young children. Although many modern parents dont think of measles as a serious threat, it remains one of theleading causes of death among young children around the world, largely in countries where kids dont have access to the vaccine.
The number of measles cases linked to an unvaccinated woman who visited Disneyland last month has recently topped 100. The rapid spread of the disease has affected some children who are physically unable to get immunized. Five babies too young to get their shots recently contracted measles at a daycare in Chicago. One child was diagnosed with measles after attending a daycare in Santa Monica, forcing the parents of 14 other infants to quarantine their kids.",12,30,24.133333333333333,0,0.6417011176717693,0.4327038823487772,0.43083997401926255,0.4109699603997999,0.06666666666666667,0.352124196158624,0.3498358486273374,0.3407973090774418,0.35638496244815415,0.19713799206441954,0.18641876476927122,0.17682264075749035,0.1931093738844451,0.14164293034957723,1.2163089041098178,0.241566814989376,0.15545620488744144,1.3385916830689488,0.26610046186240965,0.15727376192901976,1.3492007569444966,0.2683817496212302,0.15760365290288242,1.3480324128124537,0.26887405488250316,0.019791666666666666,0.01622174122174122,0.023529411764705882,0.026538987688098495,3.2120275718764018,3.6299682988990636,0,0,1.1907929281309142,6.945963699918353,9.294240470514989,-0.4111584063688258,-0.13241056381487867,0.3380811986623284,,0.09351409123065438,0.11419945177574009,1.7992718976420337,1.6767927630897574,-0.5182695792736317,-0.8024401173956575,-0.43609215349190733,0.9632465128661688,0.9287368594914595,-0.7779745919984435,-0.5022002797709385,0.761112964398212,0.5201384821396672,1.1061557375404794,1.2304250530732939,1.1760311674374442,1.265462364424695,1.4363697221829246,1.368035447051864,-0.018947710947240442,0.2836000592583121,0.09304378144647142,-0.035120835319220736,0.2664485768214643,0.13886015158866855,-0.3333592536351776,-0.5262778706913991,-0.4202747426761515,-0.5814736276947201,0.8638901177936659,1.096978051031929,,,0.8874624573216611,1.2341260225836947,-0.05304527680535719,0,0.3309897407709994
88,yes_155.txt,"Lions Club, Congress both support vaccination programs [Letter]
Thank you for your Dec. 4 coverage of the Laurel Lions Club's 59th annual Christmas tree sale. Our community is blessed by their partnering with Laurel Advocacy and Referral Services to assist Laurel families who need eye exams and eye glasses.
Until your article inspired me to search for more information, I hadn't known that Lions Clubs internationally provide programs that are estimated to have saved the sight of nearly 3 million children, and that they've vaccinated 41 million children in Africa against measles a leading cause of childhood blindness and even death.
The vaccine program is of particular interest to me because I volunteer with the anti-poverty organization RESULTS, which is asking our members of Congress to support a substantial 4-year pledge to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, at the Jan. 27, 2015, meeting in Berlin, Germany. The hope is that pledges by governments, corporations, foundations and civic organizations like Lions Clubs will total $7.5 billion over four years. That will enable Gavi to immunize 300 million children, thereby saving an estimated 5-6 million lives. Lions Clubs have committed to raising $30 million for Gavi by 2017, their 100th anniversary.
This past Thursday, the Senate resolution in support of Gavi, led by Senators Menendez (Democrat) and Rubio (Republican) and signed by Maryland's Ben Cardin, passed out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The companion House resolution, led by 18 primary cosponsors 9 Republicans and 9 Democrats, is still open for signatures. Rep. John Delaney and Rep. Chris Van Hollen have signed on.

My 8-year-old daughter clearly had whooping cough. A doctor and a test confirmed it.
About a week later, my 5-year-old daughter started complaining about an itch in the back of her throat and started coughing.
How could this happen? My kids have had their shots, including the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, or DTaP, vaccines.
Von Miller (58) of the Denver ...
I blame the anti-vaccination movement for my kids seemingly ceaseless coughs.
About 15 percent to 20 percent of kids who get vaccinated for pertussis, or whooping cough, wont be 100 percent immune. That is why the herd immunity concept becomes important. If more kids get vaccinated, there is a reduced chance the illness will spread to vulnerable populations.
Pertussis is the 100-day cough because it goes on and on. Antibiotics have stopped its spread, but my daughters faces continue to turn red as they hack and hack through the night.
A recent measles outbreak from an exposure at Disneyland sparked a national debate about vaccinations. Measles, like pertussis, can be controlled through vaccinations, but it requires herd immunity.
Colorado has not kept up.
The states kindergartners have the countrys worst reported vaccination rate, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Our pertussis prevention is abysmal. Fewer than 80.9 percent of Colorado kindergartners had DTaP vaccinations for the 2013-14 school year, compared to the national 95 percent median rate.
Between 2011 and 2012, the number of pertussis cases in Colorado increased by 258.5 percent, from 8.2 to 29.4 cases per 100,000 population. In 2013, there were 1,458 confirmed cases, and last year 1,246 cases.
Boulder County historically has high numbers of pertussis cases. It also has many under-immunized children and personal exemptions to immunizations.
In Boulder Valley schools, where my kids attend, the vaccination rate, including opt-outs, is a paltry 82 percent.
At least 92 percent should be immunized for herd immunity to be successful, experts say.
Nevertheless, in Boulder one of the most highly educated counties in the country parents willfully ignore science and public health concerns by opting out on something so important.
Some argue pertussis vaccines are ineffective, that they wear off, that the vaccine is unsafe and the risks outweigh the benefits.
Yet in 2013, only three hospitalized cases in Colorado were associated with adverse vaccine reactions, compared to 538 hospitalizations for potentially vaccine-preventable diseases. That added up to a health care cost of $29 million.
While the vast majority of kids with pertussis simply cough for months, the bacterial infection can be fatal and kills 200,000 children worldwide every year.
Additionally, the illness is blamed for millions of dollars in lost productivity due to time away from school and work and in health care expenses.
By shunning the vaccine, people perpetuate a public health menace, said Dr. Larry Wolk, director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.
You dont want to be the one who spreads that to someone who is immune-compromised who it will kill, Wolk said.
For the next several weeks, my daughters seemingly endless coughing fits will provide a regular reminder of the importance of vaccines.

90,yes_157.txt,"Theres no debate that vaccines work
By Luther F. Cobb, M.D.
There has been endless debate around the importance and need for vaccination over the last several weeks, starting with a terrifying outbreak of a once-eradicated disease right here in California. As the President of the California Medical Association (CMA) representing over 40,000 members across the state, Im here to tell you why we have to stop politicizing a public health issue.
The advent of vaccines that reliably prevent communicable illnesses was an important step in public health and has led to a host of other vaccines now available and recommended that have greatly decreased deaths and disease. In fact, the discovery and application of vaccines constitutes probably the greatest contribution to life expectancy in medical history.
For years, the rates of unvaccinated children have been slowly rising due to Internet rumor mongering and debunked scientific studies. However, were starting to see headway with legislation that passed recently in California; in 2014, for the first time in a decade, the number of parents who filed personal belief exemption forms to exempt their kindergartners from vaccinations has declined. Assembly Bill 2109, which was sponsored by CMA and authored by Sacramento pediatrician and California state Sen. Richard Pan, M.D., requires a parent or guardian seeking a personal belief exemption from school immunization to first obtain a document signed by a licensed health care practitioner. In the form, the practitioner is asked to attest that the parent or guardian has been informed of the benefits and risks of the immunization, as well as the health risks of the diseases that a child could contract if left unvaccinated.
Humboldt County coronavirus information graphic. ...
AB 2109 was born out of a rising concern around the increased personal belief exemptions in California and what that could mean for outbreaks of diseases like measles, mumps and pertussis. Exposure to these diseases not only puts individual children at risk, but the community as a whole, including infants too young to be immunized. Reduced numbers of personal belief exemption forms leads to decreased numbers of preventable outbreaks and it is imperative for the health of our state that we continue in this direction.
My parents saw the days of children in iron lungs and leg braces from the destructive effects of diseases like polio and I myself grew up in a day when the results of measles were seen regularly. Unfortunately, in these days of good public health, many of these memories have faded. Now that these illnesses are uncommon, we shouldnt have to resurrect their awful impacts to remind people of the catastrophe, debilitation and in some cases, death that comes along with them.
Measles may be the current topic of discussion, but it shouldnt stop there. Just a few years ago, California had some of the lowest pneumonia vaccination rates in the country. Bacterial pneumococcal infections are a leading cause of death for seniors who contract the flu because so many are not immunized against pneumonia. The fact is, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends pneumococcal vaccines (http://www.cdc.gov/H1n1flu/HAN/111609.htm) for all people 65 years of age and older and for people 2 to 64 years of age with certain high-risk conditions.
And, just last year, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) reported an increase in cases of pertussis (whooping cough). According to the state, a total of 10,831 cases were reported, with more than 800 new cases reported in April alone the highest monthly count since the 2010 epidemic. Pertussis is especially dangerous to infants, yet it is preventable with proper immunization treatment.
This is especially important for rural communities like ours where many patients have to travel long distances to see their physician, which can lead to prolonged illness and greater risks.
This controversy will persist as long as these unnecessary epidemics occur and recur. The debate should end. Why do we need an outbreak of preventable diseases to remind us that vaccines are safe, effective and life saving?

91,yes_159.txt,"A Reminder: Merck Strategy Chief, Former Vaccine President, Former CDC Chief told CNN Vaccines Cause Autism
Managing Editor's Note: We ran this post in February, 2011. It seems Jan - Mar is the PR lead up to autism ""awareness month"" whereby Americans must be reminded (with a hammer to the head) that vaccine injury does not happen, nor is autism association with vaccination. Dr. Paul Offit's books debut each winter like the Groundhog wriggling out of his grotto - Offit's goal of course is to protect vaccination while smearing autism and vaccine safety community members. This year even Autism Speaks - The Blue Bomb of autism told Americans to vaccinate their children, amidst the measles hype. 
Dr. Julie Gerberding was the Head of the CDC. She left, and within a year, became President of the Vaccine Division for MERCK (makers of the MMRII and Gardasil vaccines.) In December she received a promotion to Executive Vice President for Strategic Communications, Global Public Policy and Population Health. Read that title again. ""Strategic communications."" Think about the intense media hype around the 100+ cases of measles, a disease that was so common and non-threatening that TV sitcoms like The Brady Bunch and Married with Children poked fun at transmission. Here's some strategic communication from our John Stone - it was Dr. Gerberding who...
It wasnt Andrew Wakefield who said vaccines cause autism Mr Gates, it was Julie Gerberdingand she told Sanjay Gupta
By John Stone
Now, we all know that vaccines can occasionally cause fevers in kids. So if a child was immunized, got a fever, had other complications from the vaccines. And if youre predisposed with the mitochondrial disorder, it can certainly set off some damage. Some of the symptoms can be symptoms that have characteristics of autism.""
Julie Gerberding, present head of Mercks vaccine division speaking to Sanjay Gupta on the subject of the Hannah Poling case when she was still head of the Centers for Disease Control.
The one thing Sanjay Guptas interview with Bill Gates on Friday did not do was add to informed, intelligent discussion about vaccine safety. What we undoubtedly had was a commercial for Bill Gatess global vaccine programme, and the repetition of a lot of unpleasant allegations about Andrew Wakefield which do not bear examination. Perhaps the single point that he most has to answer if he wants to say that kind of thing is to explain how Wakefield could have changed data under the noses of 12 senior specialist/consultants, who then failed to say anything about it for 13 years or more, despite the continuing controversy. And by the way Gupta has to answer it too. Just because these things were claimed in a once respectable medical journal does not mean that they are remotely credible. What Gates says contradicts what Gerberding told Gupta, and what Wakefield told Gupta. It was also not what he heard from John Poling (HERE ). So Gupta should not be sitting there like a block of wood saying nothing: it leads to mistrust.
Lets just examine briefly the implications of what Gerberding said in that interview three years ago. According to a CDC study from 2006 (HERE ) 33 out 1800 infants (nearly 2%) suffered a fever of 39.5 or higher, although there was no long term follow up. By now it is also established the mitochondrial dysfunction is a common feature in autistic children and much higher than in the general population (JAMA Mito Dysfunction in Autism , and Mitochondrial dysfunction can connect the diverse medical symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorders , Novel plasma phospholipid biomarkers of autism: mitochondrial dysfunction as a putative causative mechanism, Mitochondrial dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders: a population-based study ). Commonly adverse reactions are not monitored or investigated in any detail it is left to families to bring legal actions if they dare, or have the energy left. So actually we have no means of tracing the impact of vaccines on this issue. As Bernardine Healy, a former National Institute of Health director, warned on CBS news you cannot actually rule it out unless you study sub-groups (CBS News HERE ).
However, despite all the obstacles the US vaccine court has paid out more than $2b on MMR and DPT related claims since 1988 (HERE ), although claimants are well advised to stress neurological impairment rather than autism, which is a non-specific psychiatric diagnosis (HuffPo HERE ).
The most likely reading is that only a tiny percentage of cases ever get compensated, but even if they were the only cases Gates would be guilty of perpetuating a fairy story: on the best reading vaccines are only relatively safe, meanwhile the fact that they can cause autism has been conceded by the US government both on the legal and scientific front: a more pertinent question in the circumstances is how often?.
One thing I regret about Gatess intervention is the blood libel against advocates of greater vaccine safety and caution: such events have not happened to his children so perhaps he should not really comment. Of course, it is very easy to design studies that do not find anything. Cochranes review of MMR sifted 5,000 studies, reviewed in detail 31 epidemiological studies (supposedly the best) and declared them to be largely inadequate, against which the failure to detect any connection between the vaccine and autism must be measured . The bare faced hostility manifested against ordinary citizens reporting damage is suggestive of a bullying and unscientific attitude towards facts.
Gates has for long been reckoned one of the richest men in the world, and the most successful, if not the best, manufacturer of computer software. The success, above all, has been in making sure virtually everyone has to have his products. He now seems poised to try and repeat the success with vaccines, but unless he employs a lighter hand it is unlikely to be without much human damage.

92,yes_16.txt,"January 2015 Saw More Measles Cases Than All of 2012
The number of measles cases in the United States is climbing, sparking fears the disease may be making a resurgence only 15 years after health officials announced it had been largely eradicated. The latest outbreak, which has infected dozens, is believed to have started in a Disney theme park in Anaheim, California, and has by now spread to six other states and Mexico. ""Measles is so contagiousyou can run, but you cannot hide,"" says Dr. Sharon Humiston, a professor of pediatrics at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, and associate director for research for the Immunization Action Coalition.
Much of the blame for the recent outbreak has been placed on relatively low vaccination rates among schoolchildren in Southern California. Many parents in that part of the country forgo vaccines they believe to be toxic or a catalyst for illnesses like autism, despite robust research debunking those claims. In 2014, 3 percent of parents in the state submitted personal belief exemptions (PBEs)which state an opposition to vaccines for ""nonmedical reasons""to get their children out of vaccination requirements. In California's private schools, the average PBE rate is even higher. The U.S. national average in 2014, by comparison, was 1.8 percent.
Population-wide vaccination is essential to widespread immunity. What is often lost in the chatter surrounding the vaccination issue is the fact that measles is a serious health threat. Complications range from middle ear infection and diarrhea to pneumonia and brain swelling, which can be fatal. Pregnant women who catch measles are at risk for complications like spontaneous abortion, says Dr. Greg Wallace, head of the domestic measles, mumps, rubella and polio team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The good news is that most residents of the U.S. are relatively healthy and that the country has a robust health care system, which means there is only a small chance the worst complications will be experienced by more than a few. But in parts of the world where malnutrition rates are high and the health care system is less equipped to manage outbreaks, measles is a real public health burden and a leading killer of children. The Philippines, for example, had 21,403 confirmed cases of measles last year. A measles vaccination campaign that began in health centers and churches across the Philippines in September is targeting 11 million children and conducting door-to-door checks to ensure no children have been missed.
U.S. health officials are starting to express concern. ""If you look at our 10 largest outbreaks since elimination was declared in 2000, the vast majority of them have been in the last few years,"" said Wallace. Last year, 644 people were infected with measles in the U.S., the most since the disease was largely eliminated in 2000 and a 244 percent increase from the 187 cases seen in 2013. The 102 Americans infected in this year's outbreak are already far more than the total number of people infected with measles in the U.S. in 2012, which was 55.
Before the measles vaccination program started in 1963, the disease was endemic in the U.S., according to the CDC. Three million to 4 million Americans a year caught measles, just under 50,000 were hospitalized, 4,000 developed brain swelling, and between 400 and 500 died.
If the current outbreak continues to grow, the U.S. will need more resources and a greater public health response, as well as better ways to limit exposure and make sure people are up to date on their vaccinations, Wallace said. One positive outcome from the mild hysteria surrounding the Disney outbreak is that the public is more attuned to the dangers measles poses.

93,yes_163.txt,"U.S. measles outbreak puts local focus on vaccination
NORTHAMPTON, Mass. (WWLP) A measles outbreak that started in California has western Massachusetts public health officials stressing the importance of getting vaccinated.
There are at least 141 cases of the measles related to the outbreak at Disney. So far, none in Massachusetts, but the City of Northampton is no stranger to measles. In April of 2014 a Smith College Professor contracted measles on an oversea trip. She did not get her travel vaccinations.
Getting a vaccine is easy. The needles are small. It only takes about three seconds. You only feel a pinch, and you have lifelong immunity. From the flu, to certain strains of cervical cancer, it can all be prevented. But Northampton Public Health Director Merridith OLeary said some are standing in the way.
With international travel and this anti vaccine movement, we dont have herd immunity and we are seeing these infectious diseases making a comeback. They are measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, polio is making its way back, said OLeary.
The CDC recommends 49 vaccine doses by age six. Parents told 22News it shouldnt be optional.
I dont think that parents should have the choice, unless there is a really compelling religious reason. This has been one of the most incredible medical advances in the last 100 years, said Lynne Brill of Florence.
Even if you think the disease isnt here anymore, there are people who come here from other places that might have it and can start all over again, said Debra Wing-Colson of Florence.
Reports of a link between vaccines and autism have been proved false. If your unsure if youve been vaccinated for a disease, a simple blood draw will provide the answer.
Vaccines are widely available from your local pharmacy, doctors office, and community health department.

94,yes_164.txt,"Vaccine-preventable diseases making a comeback
Lagos - Families with underimmunised or unvaccinated children tend to cluster together, a new study shows.
Vaccine rates remain high
Underimmunisation is tied to an increased risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, the researchers write in the journal Paediatrics.
""We now have the opportunity to use really sophisticated methods to identify these kinds of clusters of undervaccination or vaccine refusal,"" said Dr. Tracy Lieu, the study's lead author from the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research in Oakland, California.
""With tools like these we have much more power and ability to identify emerging issues than anyone would have 20 or 30 years ago,"" she said.
While the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reports that vaccine rates remain high, some vaccine-preventable diseases, like measles, have made comebacks in recent years.
Lieu and colleagues hope that by identifying clusters of people who refuse to vaccinate their children or refuse certain shots, researchers can target prevention efforts.
For the new study, they analysed records for 154,424 children born between 2000 and 2011 in 13 California counties. All were members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large nonprofit health plan.
Problem with misconceptions
Using those records, they were able to identify five clusters with higher rates of three-year-olds who had missed at least one vaccine.
About 18 percent to 23 percent of children in those clusters were underimmunised, compared to about 11 percent of children outside those clusters.
Children whose parents refused vaccines were also clustered in geographic areas. Rates of refusal ranged from about 6 percent to about 14 percent in the clusters, compared to about 3 percent outside of those areas.
In addition to targeting those areas for public health messages, Lieu said doctors can be more alert to the possibility of vaccine-preventable disease.
""If you know there is a cluster of undervaccination or vaccine refusal in a certain area, you may be more vigilant,"" she said.
The study can't say why these areas of underimmunisation and vaccine refusal formed, however.
""This really identifies a nice mechanism to identify where there might be a problem with misconceptions or whatever the reason is, but an area where resources can be well spent to provide more focused information and dispel and misinformation people may have,"" said Dr. Amar Safdar, an infectious disease expert at NYU Langone Medical Centre who was not involved with the new study.
Safdar said parents sometimes believe vaccines are dangerous.
""The reason why science and medicine is behind vaccination is that there is no identifiable damage to the kids,"" he said.

95,yes_166.txt,"Vaccines Are One of Our Best Weapons Against Global Warming
Climate change could make deadly diseases like rotavirus even worse.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has suggested that vaccines cause profound mental disorders. Paul has also said hes not sure anybody exactly knows why the climate changes. So the likely presidential contender would probably find this fact pretty confusing: According to leading scientists, vaccines are among the most effective weapons in our arsenal for combating the threats that global warming poses to human health.
In its landmark report (PDF) last year, the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that global warming poses a range of health threatsespecially in the developing world. Warmer temperatures and changes in rainfall will reduce crop production, leading to malnutrition. Foodborne and waterborne illnesses will become a bigger problem. And, some scientists argue, diseases like malaria will spread as the insects that carry them migrate to new areas.
So how should humanity adapt to these dangers? The IPCC report lays out a slew of public health interventions, including widespread vaccination:
The most effective measures to reduce vulnerability in the near term are programs that implement and improve basic public health measures such as provision of clean water and sanitation, secure essential health care including vaccination and child health services, increase capacity for disaster preparedness and response, and alleviate poverty.
There are a number of reasons that vaccines will play an important role in our efforts to adapt to a warming world. The most obvious is their ability to protect vulnerable populations from diseases that will be made worse by climate change.
A prime example is rotavirus, a vaccine-preventable disease that can cause severe diarrhea. It killed roughly 450,000 children in 2008mostly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, according to the World Health Organization. There is evidence that case rates of rotavirus are correlated with warming temperatures and high rainfall, according to Erin Lipp, an environmental health professor at the University of Georgia and a contributor to the IPCC report. This is particularly true in developing countries with poor sanitation and drinking water sources, Lipp explained in an email.
There are other, less direct, ways in which climate change can exacerbate a wide range of existing public health problems. Take measles, which is currently making a comeback in the United Statesthanks in large part to the unscientific claims of the anti-vaccination movement. Measles killed nearly 150,000 people worldwide in 2013; its particularly common in parts of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia that have extremely low vaccination ratesareas that will be hit especially hard by the impacts of climate change.
Unlike with rotavirus, theres no direct relationship between measles and global warming. But Kirk Smithan environmental health expert at UC, Berkeley, and a lead author of the IPCC chapter on health impactspoints out that a child weakened by measles is more likely to die from the malnutrition caused by climate change. In other words, anything we can do to reduce the impact of existing health problems will be even more important in a warming world. And vaccinating children, he says, is one of the most cost-effective public health tools we have.
Diseases like measles pose another threat, as well, says Alistair Woodward, who is also a lead author of the IPCC chapter. Woodward, an epidemiologist at the University of Auckland, points out that extreme climate eventscrop failures in Africa, flooding in Bangladesh, and even storms like Hurricane Katrinacan displace large numbers of people. In these circumstances, with crowding and poor living conditions, all the basic public health services are put under great strain, said Woodward in an email. The risks of infection go through the roof, for all communicable diseasesSo ensuring that people are vaccinated is a logical thing to do as part of managing the risks of a rapidly changing climate.
Of course, making sure people are inoculated against deadly diseases isnt easy. In the developing world, vaccination campaigns have to overcome transportation and security issues, as well as poor local health care systems. And these challenges, says Woodward, can dwarf the problems caused by the anti-vaxxer movement.",12,32,24.1875,0,0.5735407894657504,0.42794662780098375,0.3208238970902231,0.32391664096050793,0.21875,0.35376384037346403,0.30783150741738646,0.30600593082746264,0.276004166189861,0.19285764565243374,0.18460260715241297,0.15844629884027125,0.15384862578031394,0.1428350309378921,1.200860498485337,0.2388569510298799,0.13531688567598787,1.1516064179910452,0.2273861230860649,0.1591745895349815,1.3682528209704912,0.2713828575132202,0.1626431111885306,1.3754954972285498,0.27262211307253525,0.01893939393939394,0.026641414141414143,0.02702702702702703,0.03027027027027027,3.078877297044846,3.4795457189117345,0,0,1.1099745679157444,6.5903354088104455,9.143018849808184,-0.4111584063688258,-0.04600508125490497,0.3488350013999544,,-0.48610652050955944,0.07644926722980279,0.8032676067829303,0.8750487748653186,0.08412054845115144,-0.7595170391728465,-1.7886259571662375,0.6343687593230664,-0.354758898277804,-0.9170937863019976,-0.5944486653954238,0.4479748894648127,-0.48255809553935114,1.1347289017123783,1.1850946524280959,1.1366954840246475,0.4255042005395126,0.48187190398677426,0.389804199754487,0.1824267558908934,0.6658613894869414,0.35012776513285293,0.6551683746457719,0.8765903985308295,0.5355306519352154,-0.36164746395670744,-0.17627325562127774,-0.3135029965516032,-0.376637120450006,-1.0237863256756234,-1.3745190117553248,,,-0.7737882542781955,0.08005420672846172,-0.5826080743421457,0,5.8240167572056905
96,yes_167.txt,"Tompkins public health director urges parents to have children vaccinated
The current measles outbreak that began in California and has spread to several other states highlights a problem that continues to grow in the United States parents choosing not to vaccinate their children. Measles was once a common disease in this country. Before the vaccination program started in 1963, the CDC estimates that about 3 to 4 million people got measles each year in the United States. Of those, 400 to 500 died, 48,000 were hospitalized, and 4,000 developed encephalitis (brain swelling) from measles.
Vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella and pertussis (whooping cough) are on the rise because some parents choose not to vaccinate their children. Their decision threatens the health of their child and the health of the community. When 95% of the population is vaccinated for measles for example, herd immunity is created that effectively prevents the spread of disease in the community and protects those few that cannot be vaccinated. These include those who cannot receive the vaccine for medical reasons and infants too young to receive the vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends all children get two doses of Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. Until the vaccine series is complete those children are unprotected and rely on herd immunity.
Measles is very contagious and can live for up to two hours on surfaces and in the air. According to the CDC, 90 percent of unvaccinated people in close proximity to an affected person will become infected with measles. Many of us are not old enough to remember when children regularly contracted these vaccine preventable diseases. Due to the success of the vaccine, measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000 by the CDC. However, every year measles are brought into the United States by unvaccinated travelers from countries where the disease still occurs or where outbreaks are occurring including Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. Even if you and your family dont travel, you can come in contact with travelers anywhere in the community from the supermarket to a social gathering.
We often hear parents deciding to not vaccinate out of fear the vaccine might harm their child. Lets be clear. There is no scientific evidence that vaccines harm children. To the contrary, vaccines have been proven to eliminate diseases and are considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century. There is no vaccine controversy. Vaccines save lives. A decision to not vaccinate puts the most vulnerable within our community at unnecessary risk.",5,24,21.125,0,0.5257822547269904,0.4159065313023862,0.40447243948777517,0.38819694141901673,0.08333333333333333,0.3683317189284584,0.3513593574494565,0.3172789039712389,0.3549973400370006,0.21917705224794254,0.18474924798741604,0.19185264353181286,0.18072779917423348,0.14500899491302743,1.249402884042264,0.24747136951694026,0.15409082573739696,1.2687140649098716,0.2556901743870615,0.16069554433529656,1.3481529056796748,0.2693335420248993,0.1669881217624979,1.3602266250172437,0.2745314479032815,0.04034391534391534,0.04049284049284049,0.05357142857142857,0.03696741854636591,3.183385087846445,3.5860774361202843,0,0,1.1326382876382877,6.562464202464202,9.660595077167049,-1.1182635009871913,-0.3916270114947998,-0.2591684610735104,,-0.8922347163337674,-0.01909236507233398,1.5605597178787418,1.4670577273764263,-0.4522542228106418,-0.3781549210395298,-0.38703538643507784,0.7409305073699144,0.9065797329014456,-0.06166427483492864,-0.587000313903189,1.0172284718368783,0.20392029507715617,1.1868361065692632,1.3275330269152448,1.2617401517486169,1.20851598248214,1.0796676363485431,1.1049890197173868,0.34355733976800296,0.26257593201278084,0.17457719896563806,1.2503343124083979,0.5373649362592425,0.7376024353070504,0.34880071060869855,0.2890065267363528,0.49681829100077185,-0.008983255816433236,0.4578245467372501,0.37583539778074193,,,-0.30792727397204434,-0.010392404304306541,1.2298914453536087,0,1.2854900847629638
97,yes_168.txt,"Read Roald Dahl's Powerful Letter to Parents About Vaccination From 1988
In 1962, Roald Dahl, the British author of beloved children's books including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, and Fantastic Mr Fox, lost his eldest daughter Olivia to measles. One year later, the first vaccine against the disease was introduced, in the hopes of preventing deaths like Olivia's.
Unfortunately, it's becoming increasingly clear having an available vaccine to parents isn't necessarily enough to stop the disease - we also need to convince people to use it.
Take, for example, the current measles outbreak in the United States, centred in the regions surrounding California, which has been driven largely by unvaccinated children.
In 2015, there were more than 100 confirmed cases of the disease in 14 states in the US, and more than 60 percent of these are believed to have originated at Disneyland.
As you can see in the chart below, as more and more parents decide to delay or avoid vaccinating their children altogether, it's causing a spike in the cases of the preventable disease.
One of the big issues is that people see perceived vaccination risks (most of which have been disproved vehemently by science) as worse than the disease the vaccination prevents. But this is definitely not the case. As Dahl saw first-hand, measles is a deadly disease. And just like the parents of the 145,700 people who died of measles around the world last year - the majority of which were children under five - he was painfully aware of the need for protection against it.
In an effort to remind other parents of just what is at stake, 26 years after Olivia's death, Dahl penned this powerful letter, published in a pamphlet the Sandwell Health Authority.
And it's just as important today, if not more so, as it was back then. You can read the full letter below, originally shared over at io9.
Measles: A Dangerous Illness
Olivia, my eldest daughter, caught measles when she was seven years old. As the illness took its usual course I can remember reading to her often in bed and not feeling particularly alarmed about it. Then one morning, when she was well on the road to recovery, I was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldn't do anything.
""Are you feeling all right?"" I asked her.
""I feel all sleepy,"" she said.
In an hour, she was unconscious. In twelve hours she was dead.
The measles had turned into a terrible thing called measles encephalitis and there was nothing the doctors could do to save her. That was twenty-four years ago in 1962, but even now, if a child with measles happens to develop the same deadly reaction from measles as Olivia did, there would still be nothing the doctors could do to help her.
On the other hand, there is today something that parents can do to make sure that this sort of tragedy does not happen to a child of theirs. They can insist that their child is immunised against measles. I was unable to do that for Olivia in 1962 because in those days a reliable measles vaccine had not been discovered. Today a good and safe vaccine is available to every family and all you have to do is to ask your doctor to administer it.
It is not yet generally accepted that measles can be a dangerous illness. Believe me, it is. In my opinion parents who now refuse to have their children immunised are putting the lives of those children at risk. In America, where measles immunisation is compulsory, measles like smallpox, has been virtually wiped out.
Here in Britain, because so many parents refuse, either out of obstinacy or ignorance or fear, to allow their children to be immunised, we still have a hundred thousand cases of measles every year. Out of those, more than 10,000 will suffer side effects of one kind or another. At least 10,000 will develop ear or chest infections. About 20 will die.
LET THAT SINK IN.
Every year around 20 children will die in Britain from measles.
So what about the risks that your children will run from being immunised?
They are almost non-existent. Listen to this. In a district of around 300,000 people, there will be only one child every 250 years who will develop serious side effects from measles immunisation! That is about a million to one chance. I should think there would be more chance of your child choking to death on a chocolate bar than of becoming seriously ill from a measles immunisation.
So what on earth are you worrying about? It really is almost a crime to allow your child to go unimmunised.
The ideal time to have it done is at 13 months, but it is never too late. All school-children who have not yet had a measles immunisation should beg their parents to arrange for them to have one as soon as possible.
Incidentally, I dedicated two of my books to Olivia, the first was 'James and the Giant Peach'. That was when she was still alive. The second was 'The BFG', dedicated to her memory after she had died from measles. You will see her name at the beginning of each of these books. And I know how happy she would be if only she could know that her death had helped to save a good deal of illness and death among other children.

98,yes_169.txt,"Immunizations have led to a healthier population
Recent issues of the Broadcaster have raised the issue of immunizations and current popular anti-vaccination trends. Im not one to send frequent letters to the editor. I prefer to work away quietly, doing my best to optimize the health of patients, advocating for them in a sometimes complex health care system. It is my passion and I continue to feel inspired, humbled, and privileged.
Regarding immunizations, I am awestruck by the work of those who have come before me. Due to the efforts of Louis Pasteur, a bite by a known rabid animal can now consistently be cured. Small pox, a disease which led to the yearly death of millions, has been eradicated from the earth due a worldwide campaign of immunization. Polio, a condition which resulted in death or permanent disability in so many, is nearing eradication due to the brilliance of men such as Salk and Sabin, who developed vaccines against this condition. Tetanus is a serious condition, leading to a painful death or disability in many survivors. The muscle contractions of tetanus can literally fracture bones. Tetanus vaccine is well tolerated and has eliminated tetanus in those properly immunized. Since the causative organism is found throughout the environment, tetanus will continue to be a risk for the unimmunized. The genealogist reviewing census records sees many examples of families from the early 20th century whose children were all killed during a diphtheria outbreak. There are many other success stories including the eradication of congenital rubella syndrome and the virtual elimination of Hib bacteria meningitis, which was a common condition during the 1980s and earlier. For those in our community who speak against immunization, do you believe the above achievements are a conspiracy of medicine?
I am concerned that with our affluent and healthy society, we have lost touch with how fortunate we are to have healthy children. As grandparents we have an obligation to educate our children and grandchildren about what the world was like before vaccinations were available. Our country is swept up in an anti-intellectual frenzy, questioning the benefits of immunization, the reality of global warming, and the relevance of evolution, as expressed in this weeks National Geographic magazine. I believe that our chiropractic colleagues, while performing much good work, have lost their way on this issue and contribute to this misinformation campaign leading to a needlessly vulnerable population.",4,20,22.3,0,0.48218433206018646,0.31771640812389945,0.2873576495796442,0.2498948118959864,0.35,0.3558412805459527,0.36428814938074827,0.34292840956180703,0.29019348271450496,0.1950312600752642,0.18970541498302845,0.17167775976453342,0.14837836218489842,0.14283908937323903,1.2423796657427169,0.2465196141143271,0.11326572219606576,0.9810388361612988,0.19430127115965035,0.15063519181696985,1.315372601022057,0.2592841424775385,0.15348048544397702,1.3267560390950437,0.26316976040875595,0.0392156862745098,0.017604617604617605,0.024390243902439025,0.027874564459930314,3.0574800994953217,3.5059688939261417,0,0,1.1026938537652824,6.747606079871117,9.583008722740413,-1.2192785145041007,-0.5644379766147471,-0.025893663226548243,,-1.2629819716925512,-0.7982592634035257,0.5002889235765763,0.1933222556227818,0.6039914805971971,-0.7051332123524402,0.029269872117612044,0.9833914905913059,-0.12818826931184832,-0.8464472876017982,-0.3352609274167318,0.6734427339925421,-0.6222654330454369,1.1348261773454795,1.3069247319833297,1.2479247168178642,-0.4941919715929381,-0.3888190814427798,-0.4461815613248417,-0.7222405885805232,-0.39512933533378874,-0.6862847767690894,-0.5998993980998234,-0.20624433787901483,-0.46484588185633735,0.3113530953267481,-0.47982601756610876,-0.3939961089293114,-0.5081543668040139,-1.3271351983804898,-0.940376747720749,,,-0.923445974766565,0.5904231888089323,0.9581918913558966,0,5.220962020346296
99,yes_17.txt,"Kaiser study: Clusters of unvaccinated children in Bay Area
Researchers have identified several geographic hot spots in the Bay Area where parents are not vaccinating their children, triggering concern about potential outbreaks of dangerous and preventable infectious diseases.
This unique study which uses statistical software to match electronic medical records to home addresses of Kaiser patients reveals precisely where physicians can target their vaccination efforts and detect disease outbreaks quicker.
One cluster is in the East Bay communities of El Cerrito, Berkeley, Oakland and Alameda, where parents rejected vaccines for 10.2 percent of children. The second was in the northern part of San Francisco, as well as Marin County and the southwestern part of Sonoma County, with a 6.6 percent rate of vaccine refusal.
Anecdotally, doctors have reported that a lot of parents in a particular neighborhood or county have hesitations about vaccines, said lead investigator Dr. Tracy A. Lieu of Kaisers Division of Research, based in Oakland. This is the first time weve used computers to actually find these clusters.
Specifically identified were the San Francisco neighborhoods of the Marina, Pacific Heights and Richmond; in Marin, the cities of Mill Valley, Sausalito, Belvedere, San Rafael and rural West Marin towns such as Bolinas.
By comparison, there was a 2.6 percent rate of vaccine refusal among Kaiser Northern California members outside of these clusters.
The team also detected clusters of under-immunization where between 18 and 23 percent of children received some, but not all, vaccines in similar geographic areas, compared with 11 percent outside clusters.
Kaiser Permanentes electronic medical record system, among the most extensive in the world, is a rich resource for research, said Lieu. The study analyzed the immunization records of more than 154,000 Kaiser Permanente Northern California members between birth and 3 years old. Kaiser provides health care for about 40 percent of the insured population in 13 Northern California counties.
They studied compliance with the Centers for Disease Controls immunization schedule, which requires a minimum of 17 separate injections during a childs first two years of life, including for hepatitis A and B, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza, polio, measles, mumps, rubella and pneumococcal virus.
The Kaiser study did not find elevated rates of unvaccinated children in other regions of the Bay Area.
But a previous study of average vaccination rates in all Bay Area children, not just Kaiser members, found that the most vaccinations are in Contra Costa County and Santa Clara County, where 93.6 percent and 93.5 percent of children are vaccinated, respectively. The lowest were Santa Cruz County, with 82.15 percent, and Marin, with 82.02 percent.
One exception to Contra Costa Countys high vaccination rate is East Bay Waldorf School, a private school in El Sobrante, where county officials found a personal belief exemption rate of 50 percent.
Doctors say non-vaccination is dangerous because it threatens whats known as herd immunity. If enough children are vaccinated, the whole population is protected. But if even a small number of children arent getting their shots, the immunity rate of the entire community can drop below safe levels.
The Kaiser study is significant because all children are insured and thus have equal access to preventive care. What it reveals, instead, are cultural differences.
Asian children are more likely to be vaccinated than white, Latino or African-American children, the study found.
In more affluent communities, parents have more questions about vaccines, and may reject them, Lieu said. In poorer communities, parents struggle to get time off work for doctors appointments.
Vaccine opponent Cynthia Cournoyer of Grants Pass, Oregon, said that parents are feeling overwhelmed by the number of vaccines. Theyre being inundated with so many sometimes nine different vaccines in one visit, she said.
Cournoyer, whose three children were not vaccinated, added that parents hear and see what is happening to their children, such as developmental delays, a contention disputed by physicians.
In California, a parent or guardian can refuse a vaccination if they file a letter with the schools governing board that immunization is contrary to his or her beliefs. Parents can also file a statement from their physician stating that immunization wouldnt be safe for the child.
But refusing a vaccine puts other people at risk, as well: infants who are too young to get shots, children who havent had their full series of vaccines and adults who cant get vaccinated for medical reasons such as pregnancy or immune-system problems.
The evidence is pretty clear, said Lieu, that parents who decline vaccines increase the risk of preventable disease not only in their children but also in other community members.

100,yes_171.txt,"Parents Relieved as Son Gets First Post-Leukemia Vaccines
Rhett Krawitt, of Corte Madera, received the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine on Friday at the Prima Medical Group in Greenbrae. (Lisa Aliferis/KQED)
Its been a big week for 7-year-old Rhett Krawitt.
On Tuesday, he stood on a folding chair at the podium to address his southern Marin school districts board members and urged them to adopt a resolution in favor of ending the vaccine personal belief exemption in California. Television news crews lined one side of the auditorium. Rhett is recovering from cancer, and hes become the face of the importance of widespread vaccination.
Because Rhett is recovering from years of chemotherapy, hes been unable to be vaccinated. His immune system wasnt strong enough.
Until now.
This week, Rhett went in for a check up, and his family learned that he is now able to be immunized. On Friday, Rhett got the first round of vaccines.
Its such a milestone for us. Its such a marking point in how far weve come. said Rhetts mother, Jodi Krawitt, in reference to Rhett being one year from the end of his treatment. She said she had wondered, Would we ever get to this day? And here we are.
Among the three shots Rhett received, perhaps the most important was the MMR measles, mumps, rubella. This first of two doses offers 95 percent protection against measles, the disease of greatest concern to the Krawitts in light of the ongoing outbreak in California.
Its a lot of emotions altogether, Jodi Krawitt said. Its one of those things you think youd never get excited about, getting a shot.
Carl and Jodi gained national attention after their story was first told on State of Health. They advocate a change in state policy to eliminate the personal belief exemption which permits parents to lawfully send their children to school unvaccinated.
Rhett had been vaccinated against many illnesses before he was diagnosed with leukemia when he was two. But three years of chemotherapy wiped out the protection of the vaccines. While he was undergoing chemotherapy, his parents kept him isolated to protect him, they said. He missed years of pre-school.
But he was well enough to start kindergarten on time, when he was five.
Then came a new fear measles. Rhett, and anyone else with a weak immune system, relies on herd immunity. Thats when so many people in a community, such as a school, are vaccinated, that if a disease is introduced, it cannot spread. While the overwhelming majority of parents in Marin vaccinate their children, the county has a personal belief exemption rate triple the statewide average, 6.45 percent. Pockets within the county have refusal rates significantly higher.
While Rhetts parents are delighted by their sons recovery, their commitment to the importance of vaccination goes on. This is not about Rhett, Carl Krawitt said, Its about the expecting mothers, children under one, [too young to be vaccinated against some diseases] and hundreds of kids across the Bay Area going through chemotherapy.
Herd immunity protects immunocompromised adults, too, including people being treated for cancer or people living with HIV.",16,36,17.0,0,0.49556255979197367,0.27982074653781536,0.23863959688848504,0.24166574795963242,0.027777777777777776,0.36970762829628906,0.3301368782904854,0.29970296378166456,0.25571971991389764,0.21591265685856342,0.19533778027082294,0.16967182937618075,0.1600878560853686,0.11529389741859303,0.9169243862910896,0.1864359244634517,0.11756794313638919,0.9953183139645962,0.1983483111599962,0.15435305113869696,1.32647054445967,0.2641701374506508,0.16032187729419312,1.341942976892393,0.26862115232731276,0.05113636363636363,0.041666666666666664,0.08333333333333333,0.05628415300546448,3.22911767612347,3.6505164693552956,0,0,1.1080390118625412,6.6838198288198285,9.278726092988226,-0.007098352301188288,0.12680588386504243,-1.0781119003234831,,-1.1492164317371019,-1.098972249011705,0.059231662881922754,0.11753419168471128,-0.6723054110206083,-0.34213596955702424,-1.070396192329168,0.5747877439409144,-0.678654678810227,-0.16776317729454718,-0.04917529243465235,0.6392611116060656,-0.32321179735785416,0.47460228384070896,0.35193827135736516,0.375765438822579,-0.3147576240998369,-0.3159270789497,-0.34392123317428824,-0.32836902634951415,-0.17245978018869512,-0.26773566185325753,0.3372130270185442,0.1311608040004811,0.11209456311058939,0.7070182593010872,0.32843622681394014,1.4053603406807076,1.0514490032895876,1.1061771671027059,1.4345918782412959,,,-0.8135743110871261,0.3834263991327652,-0.10737505535629499,0,-0.9338791456556023
101,yes_172.txt,"Measles vaccine proven safe
It was just a few years ago that measles was on the verge of being eradicated in North America.
Herd immunity strategies, where large portions of the population were immunized against the disease, had diminished its presence to the point where the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) seemed prepared to declare ultimate victory over measles just five years ago.
So it is a bit bizarre that there are currently18 confirmed cases in Ontario, 19 in Quebec and about 150 reported cases tied to an outbreak in California.
And more cases could be on the way.
On Monday, the province issued a warning after an infected person attended a youth event in Etobicoke, along with 1,000 other people.
In Ontario, parents are obliged to have their children vaccinated against measles at about 12 months and again before starting school. Some parents are opting out, for reasons that may have more to do with social paranoia and distrust, than solid medical evidence.
The anti-vaccine movement is a very powerful movement; it tries to marshal its arguments and forces, and unfortunately, I think at times it is not giving the true picture, says Orillia pediatrician Dr. Alan Hudak.
Its important for parents to know any supposed links between vaccines (or the vaccine preservative Thimerosal) and autism have been dismissed by the CDC, as well as by the Institute of Medicine, which conducted reviews of the medical and scientific evidence.
Thimerosal, which contains a mercury compound, is not used in childrens vaccines in Canada, with the exception of an influenza vaccine. Canadian studies conducted since the 1940s show substances added to vaccines adjuvants like aluminum hydroxide, aluminum salts or aluminum phosphate are also safe.
However, Simcoe Countys vaccination rates are about 10-per-cent lower than the 95-per-cent ideal, Hudak notes. Declining vaccination rates mean the effectiveness of the herd approach drops, raising the possibility of the spread of disease.
And measles is easily spread. The airborne virus can remain in the air for up to two hours and a carrier can be contagious for four days before and after symptoms (rash) show up.
The return of measles is a trend that can easily be reversed, but parents need to listen to doctors, not campaigning celebrities who lack the evidence to back up their claims.",13,17,25.823529411764707,0,0.7647586641833186,0.5049685583696427,0.10722041473938869,0.10722041473938869,0.0,0.342489029768677,0.32644116078698876,0.09558324439403339,0.30738291716537414,0.20496381269324393,0.17093100817616233,0.05786144494628295,0.14455949996526424,0.055736516571513676,0.45855641387779733,0.09354645890942767,0.1198014811658084,1.0297791191206904,0.20489119326791422,0.1586766080272714,1.357788505892625,0.27155337218611175,0.1595454054656582,1.3588450601404778,0.2717709677762595,0,0.0,0,0.012181616832779624,3.1879003007569016,3.5819277448600495,0,0,1.1521241563794755,6.648672994186407,9.618197172684978,-0.3101433928519164,-0.6940462004547078,0.6736387718689723,,1.1399687117642379,0.687640462453918,-1.130540532013928,-1.1206809429987106,-0.7823310051255915,-1.054672276605784,-1.1893977695072409,-1.354725777590609,0.14628731718580543,-0.5236209122127254,-1.288872388731837,-1.266019531062773,-0.7197969438587006,-0.9529138479963374,-0.9930551433349007,-0.972593985868397,-0.22160261312549712,-0.14001608766880716,-0.17859613845100888,0.12967038792998403,0.45590497761792104,0.3647345680075296,0.23085434822842968,0.5066709873222631,0.4454508790439542,-0.9902743599907043,-1.0711783043089333,-1.1385573984231125,-1.3696513211431822,0.5218368896265119,0.30765447865272183,,,0.09261182662657984,0.26936918748463934,1.0814182786048234,0,-5.83126618101411
102,yes_173.txt,"Flu shots, should you bother?
The short answer is yes. Absolutely. Positively. As we know, there are skeptics out there and our current mismatch between those flu viruses covered by the vaccine and those circulating and making people sick have the flu-shot-weary climbing out of the woodwork. Of course, I couldn't leave you with the short answer, so please read on.
If our scientists had a crystal ball, the flu vaccine and the viruses circulating in the environment would line up just right. Since that crystal ball doesn't exist, we're dealing with a flu season that involves a nasty flu virus (A H3N2) that has put on a new outfit and is different than the viruses covered by the vaccine.
However, that doesn't mean that the vaccine won't protect you from the flu. It does mean that the vaccine's ability to protect you from the flu may be reduced, but if you're vaccinated and become ill you can expect a milder illness than the skeptic who skipped the vaccine. We know from the history on these changing flu viruses that in past flu seasons, even vaccines that were not perfectly matched to the circulating viruses offered some protection.
It isn't too late to get your flu shot, and with the holiday approaching you shouldn't delay. The flu vaccine is safe, does not cause the flu, and protects you and the ones you love. The most common side effects of the flu shot are very mild. If you've heard someone say, ""I got the flu from the flu shot,"" then they've experienced a scientific miracle because it isn't possible. Those folks may have been exposed to the flu before getting vaccinated or before the vaccine had a chance to build immunity in their system. Or perhaps they were exposed to a flu virus not covered by the vaccine. Regardless, the flu shot cannot cause someone to get the flu.
So, back to the short answer. Yes. You should still get a flu shot if you haven't already and you should get one each and every year. Don't like needles? Healthy, non-pregnant people ages 2 through 49 years can get the nasal spray and skip the needle. However, the very minor pain of a flu shot is nothing compared to the suffering that can be caused by the flu.

103,yes_174.txt,"Baby Steps: Vaccines a hot topic for parents
By Kristen Pind ~ Flourish
Tuesday, March 3, 2015
As a parent, we sometimes have to do things for our kids that we don't like to do. Timeouts, making them eat their vegetables and cutting down on screen time are just a few of those things. Some are for their mental and physical well-being, while others are for their safety.
A hot topic right now is vaccinations (especially the MMR vaccine) and their effects on children's mental and physical health. Since the measles outbreak at Disneyland in December, 17 states and the District of Columbia have all had at least one proven case of measles, with more than 125 total cases tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Thankfully, Missouri is not one of those states, but it could have been, and that is a scary thought.
I am pro-vaccine. Yes, I have done research, and yes, both of my children have received all of the recommended vaccines at the recommended times. Felicity just received her MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) shot, and Cooper will get his second dose next year at age 5. My mother gave me all of the recommended vaccines as a child, and I am giving them to my children, too -- not because my doctor told me to, but because of the ease of mind I get knowing I have done all I can to protect them from a disease that has a high rate of death in children.
I know what the research says. I also know some parents prefer to disregard that research for more emotional thinking. For me, the fear of my child getting ill from measles -- a disease that was considered completely wiped out by 2000 and that had a mortality rate of 145,700 worldwide in 2013, according to the World Health Organization -- far exceeds any fear I have of the slim chance the vaccine may cause my child to get sick.
I am not judging, because part of being a parent is to make difficult decisions for the safety of your child. I am also asking you not to judge me because I, knowing you or your child had not had your recommended vaccinations, refused to let you hold my infant. My baby's immune system is not as strong as yours is. You could have given her a disease that she was not yet able to be protected from.
I also believe vaccinating your children is a choice, but to what extent? As one of my friends put it, if it's no longer a choice to wear a seat belt as it was in the past, should it still be a choice to send your child to public school without the recommended vaccines? Is your choice to not vaccinate your child more important than my child's right to not contract measles or polio?
Since the Disneyland outbreak, many states are looking to make opting out of vaccinations more difficult than just signing a piece of paper. I, for one, am glad our nation is looking at this as a real problem and not a freedom of expression issue. I have too many things to worry about with my children as it is -- I don't want to have to worry if the child swinging on the swing set next to my daughter could give her measles.
The take-home point is, parenting is difficult, and it just keeps getting more difficult. Make an educated decision in all things regarding your children, but especially on issues such as vaccines. Do research, discuss with your doctor and talk to parents who agree with you and who don't. All I ask is that we respect each other and make an educated decision for the next generation.

104,yes_176.txt,"Opinion: Tell lawmakers vaccines work
My colleagues and I at the University of Vermont Children's Hospital and the University of Vermont Medical Center are supportive of public policies that encourage Vermonters to get vaccinated. As a pediatric critical care physician, I have seen the devastating effects that vaccine-preventable illness has had on children and their families. My goals are to prevent childhood death, promote childhood health and well-being and to minimize pain and suffering when possible. Vaccines are the most important tool we have to accomplish these goals.
Vaccines work. We know this because we've eradicated smallpox worldwide. Polio, a once greatly feared illness has been eliminated from this country through vaccination. Diphtheria was a major cause of illness and death and it has all but disappeared from the U.S. after the vaccine was introduced. Cases of invasive bacterial infections like meningitis have been reduced dramatically thanks to vaccines. And vaccines that immunize against hepatitis B and HPV also prevent cancer. Next to clean water, no other intervention has had as great of an effect at reducing childhood death and improving the health of our population as have the widespread use of vaccines.
But vaccines only work if we use them. Measles was eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, but every year we're seeing more and more cases due to dropping vaccination rates. My colleagues and I who have worked in parts of the world where vaccines aren't easily accessible have seen some of the diseases that used to plague children in this country.
These diseases still exist and they're terrible. No child should become ill or die from an infection that we're able to prevent with vaccination. So we need to continue to be vigilant and protect our children from all infections, even those we tend not to see any more in this country.
Parents and pediatricians work together towards the same common goals. I encourage parents to talk to their doctors and ask questions about vaccines. Vermont parents should also visit the website oktoaskvt.org for more information about vaccines and to send in questions to be answered by local pediatricians.
We know that vaccines directly protect the child who is vaccinated. They are the most effective strategy to prevent life-threatening infection. Not only does vaccination directly benefit an individual child, it also confers an enormous public health benefit, reducing the burden of disease and indirectly benefiting those too young or otherwise unable to get vaccinated.
As pediatricians, we recommend that every child who is able to get vaccinated should, for their own health and for the health of the community.
Contact your state representative and senator and tell them to support legislation removing exemptions for vaccination.

In this Sept. 24, 2014 file photo, health workers load a suspected Ebola patient into the back of an ambulance in Freetown, Sierra Leone.
(AP Photo/Michael Duff)
I write in response to the guest opinion Greater access to vaccinations will save millions more of the worlds children (Jan. 5). The public-private partnership Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI) is a worthy investment.
Further, we must contain Ebola at its source and also press private companies to develop a vaccine.
A vaccine is the ONLY way to handle this problem. If necessary, we should dangle a sizable ""carrot"" for the first company to develop a viable vaccine and guarantee to at least cover the costs of the companies that ""lose the race."" This would encourage a lot of participation if the reward is large and the cost of ""not winning"" is mitigated.

106,yes_178.txt,"Safety is the issue for vaccination opponents
The measles outbreak, now moving across the country, has brought mass anxiety over a once common childhood illness. Fear tactics are being used to have parents of unvaccinated children rush to immunize their children.
Did you ever wonder why people choose to avoid vaccinations or the flu shot? It has nothing to do with whether vaccines work and are effective at preventing disease. It has to do with vaccine safety. Despite what you hear from every reporter on the news, vaccines are not 100 percent safe. This fact is irrefutable. Statistics show a certain percentage of children suffer from vaccine injury. Read the information that comes with the vaccine. The list of possible side effects is immense. If vaccines were 100 percent safe, why would our government set up a vaccine injury fund to compensate damaged children?
While severe reactions to vaccines don't affect most children, it is impossible to know which child will have an adverse reaction. This terrible risk is why a growing movement of parents choose not to vaccinate. These parents don't want a real risk of something happening to their children. They would rather risk their child acquiring a childhood illness, which incidentally comes with lifelong immunity that doesn't need booster shots.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 69 doses of 16 vaccines for your child. This number is more than double the vaccines prescribed 30 years ago. If the pharmaceutical industry wants more people to be vaccinated, let's start discussing corporate profits and vaccine safety. Let's not rely on studies that are severely outdated or solely funded by companies that profit from positive reports. Invent vaccines that don't contain harmful additives and chemical fillers that endanger children, such as aluminum, formaldehyde, MSG and mercury.

107,yes_179.txt,"Vaccine deniers should consider source of info
In his March 9 letter, Greg Current implored readers to remain objective about vaccinations, but his letter was anything but objective.
He wrote, To date there has been no study conducted pointing to the effectiveness of vaccines, especially one ... not funded by a pharmaceutical company.
How patently false! There are hundreds of published studies (double-blind, peer-reviewed) showing the efficacy of vaccines, and many of these were funded without any funding from pharmaceutical firms.
Think about it: Would polio and smallpox have been eradicated if vaccines were ineffective?
For a balanced perspective, Mr. Current recommends Dr. Robert S. Mendelsohns How to Raise a Healthy Child ... in Spite of Your Doctor. I spent time with Dr. Mendelsohn back in the 1970s; he was my girlfriends father.
I have read his book and, while it is interesting and passionately written, it is far from balanced. Anyone swayed by Mr. Currents arguments should consider this: Dr. Mendelsohn died quite prematurely of a skin infection because he refused to take any prescribed medication. The minor infection became fatal when it spread into his bloodstream.
Is this the man whose balanced advice you want to take when considering medical matters of life and death?

108,yes_18.txt,"Smart people acting dumb
The rash of measles cases that started in Disneyland last month has now become one of the worst outbreaks of the diseases in California in the past 15 years. What started with a handful of cases has now grown to 68 confirmed cases across the state and other cases have been reported in Colorado, Oregon, Utah, Washington state and Mexico.
California requires kids to get vaccinations for measles, mumps and rubella, but state law provides a loophole parents can get a ""personal belief waiver"" if they think there's a link between vaccines and autism and other harmful effects. That's even though studies have continuously found vaccines to be safe.
Seth Mnookin, a journalist who's chronicled the anti-vaccination movement, observed a few years ago that you only had to go visit a Whole Foods to find anti-vaxxers.
Now, it doesn't seem that anyone's actually done the science on that one, but Mnookin's point is obvious the anti-vaccination movement is fueled by an over-privileged group of rich people grouped together who swear they won't put any chemicals in their kids (food or vaccines or whatever else), either because it's trendy to be all-natural or they don't accept the science of vaccinations. Their science denying has been propelled further by celebrities such as Jenny McCarthy and Robert Kennedy Jr.
Of the 34 patients in the current measles outbreak whose vaccination status is known, only five were fully vaccinated, according to the Los Angeles Times. And the worst of the outbreak is centered in Orange County, ground zero for the anti-vaccination movement.
No one has put it more succinctly than James Cherry, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at the University of California, Los Angeles, who told the New York Times, ""There are some pretty dumb people out there.""
The real problem is that these people tend to stick together. A new study finds strong evidence that people who rejected vaccines for their children are clustered together in the same communities. And that only increases the risk that measles - a highly contagious respiratory disease that was believed to have been eradicated 15 years ago will spread to more children.
Researchers analyzing records for 55,000 children born in 13 northern California counties between 2010 and 2012 found five geographic clusters of 3-year-olds with significantly higher rates of vaccine refusal. These included East Bay (10.2 percent refusal rate); Marin and southwest Sonoma counties (6.6 percent); northeastern San Francisco (7.4 percent); northeastern Sacramento County and Roseville (5.5 percent) By comparison, the vaccine refusal rate outside these clusters is 2.6 percent, according to the study published in the journal Pediatrics.
These are some of the most privileged parts of the Bay Area. The median household income in Marin is $90,535, compared to $61,094 in the state of California. In Alameda County (home to towns like Berkeley) in the East Bay, it's $72,112. And they're also among the most liberal. Marin County, San Francisco County and Alameda County all voted overwhelmingly for Obama in 2008.
The researchers wrote that they hope their analysis will help policymakers and health-care providers focus efforts to boost vaccination rates in specific areas. We'll see just how strongly that message is received, though. Previous research has shown that confronting anti-vaxxers with science only makes them more likely to reject vaccinations.
Nationally, there were 644 new measles cases in 27 states last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the biggest annual number in nearly a quarter-century. The vast majority of people who contracted the disease were unvaccinated.
A 2014 AP-GfK survey found that only 51 percent of Americans were confident that vaccines are safe and effective, which is similar to the proportion who believe that houses can be haunted by ghosts. But the latest CDC data illustrate the troubling resurgence of a disease that, as of 2000, had been declared eliminated.",13,28,27.178571428571427,0,0.5487462229750775,0.3368301622264048,0.31284360802517486,0.3132224033467281,0.03571428571428571,0.4103756498323003,0.3671190444973569,0.3178324428831459,0.3555395522442979,0.21971687452117009,0.19682335430720235,0.16340778141859033,0.204185711593604,0.12522997700705815,1.0856320479933006,0.21347853464369135,0.13727896982678547,1.2015173697072485,0.23639681741270854,0.15211605501201733,1.3232571332712029,0.25943745174862637,0.15415233121937275,1.333301557299272,0.26347996438524207,0.035,0.028205128205128206,0,0.03292361720807726,3.1615859037263574,3.55676231823177,0,0,1.0937590052224198,6.3188265406883595,9.01651422957265,-0.3101433928519164,-0.21881604637485239,0.9426576250985275,,-0.6969541231460762,-0.6465861213661894,0.7310199646841239,0.776556945137092,-0.640869526990613,0.7224832043821688,0.12042429162705692,0.746163028845167,0.9152376101590992,-0.044119050105398364,0.026281708273644736,0.5325199589018721,0.803021678474432,0.7127577181129052,0.8469787359058086,0.7683089644774175,0.5073375824621192,0.7366507738477832,0.6174858037485573,-0.565357326033408,-0.23693378330977705,-0.6731518406782151,-0.5078720683296787,-0.060823876700993935,-0.43201587753850546,0.17142814388012206,-0.12374692939498813,-1.1385573984231125,-0.23097612928152197,0.14877669533478963,-0.10582252726501032,,,-1.1071050277385583,-0.8010363597118171,-1.0256144399672447,0,2.7924542097125364
109,yes_181.txt,"Elizabeth Warren schools the vaccine deniers and trolls Rand Paul
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is a liberal Democratic politician who is a darling of the American progressives. She came to the forefront while serving as a professor of Law at Harvard University, advocating for changes in financial regulation to benefit consumers.
However, this article isn't going to be about Senator Warren's progressive bonafides, because, this I don't usually blog about politics, except in context of science support or denialism. And with respect to vaccines, science denialism is hallmark of the left and right, though lately it's been some sort of lunatic rallying cry of the Libertarians, you know, those crackpots who think that there's too much government. They want to go back to the time of dirt roads, children working when they're 8, no rules, no regulations, and other such 1700's thinking.
Rand Paul, Senator Warren's colleague in the US Senate, babbled about mandatory vaccinations, saying it was an issue of freedom, despite the fact that the kids, who are usually the victims of vaccine preventable diseases, have no choice in the matter and lose their freedom to live healthy lives as a result of their ignorant parents. Then, Senator Paul doubled-down on his lunacy by stating that vaccines cause ""profound mental disorders."" Of course, real science says that they don't. Once again, just because one has an MD (or whatever degree), doesn't prevent them from evolving into a science denier. On the other hand,Senator Paul has no clue about the age of the earth.
On the contrary, Senator Warren is a firm, solid advocate and supporter of the need, effectiveness and safety of vaccines. And Warren is not some recent convert to the vaccine debate (it's not a debate) just to make a vaccine denying physician Senator look bad. Back in 2013, Warren was pushing for increased research funding into new and better vaccines. Last year, she was arguing that the government shutdown would affect quick development of ebola vaccines. So, she's no johnny-come-lately to the issue of vaccines.
Last week, there was a Senate hearing with the one of the leading experts on vaccines and immunization at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Anne Schuchat, MD (RADM, USPHS), the assistant Surgeon General, who has spent her whole career after her medical residency advocating for public health and studying immunization, infectious diseases, and respiratory diseases.
According to Dr. Schuchat, Public service is a privilege. For me it has also been a joy. She has given up huge salaries and glory by helping save humans from dangerous, vaccine-preventable diseases. Her expertise in vaccines intimidates me, because I couldn't hope to know what she does in a thousand years of studying. Her knowledge far exceeds the fallacious authority figures offered up by the vaccine deniers as ""proof"" of whatever delusion they're pushing this week.
But there was a moment at that Senate committee, where the entire conversation about health risks and vaccines was laid open to the essential truth. Sen. Elizabeth Warren asked Dr. Schuchat whether vaccines are safe nine different ways:
WARREN: Is there any scientific evidence that vaccines cause autism?
SCHUCHAT: No.
WARREN: Is there any scientific evidence that vaccines cause profound mental disorders? (Notedid she just troll Rand Paul? I just spit up my coffee.)
SCHUCHAT: No, but some of the diseases we vaccinate against can.
WARREN: The diseases can, but not the vaccines. Is there any scientific evidence that vaccines have contributed to the rise in allergies or autoimmune disorders among kids?
SCHUCHAT: No.
WARREN: Are there additives or preservatives in vaccines that can be toxic to kids?
SCHUCHAT: Not in the amounts that theyre in in vaccines.
WARREN: Is there any scientific evidence that giving kids their vaccines further apart or spacing them differently is healthier for kids?
SCHUCHAT: No, it actually increases the risk period for children.
WARREN: So it adds to the danger?
SCHUCHAT: Right.
WARREN: Is there any scientific evidence that kids can develop immunity to these diseases on their own, simply by eating nutritious foods or being active?
SCHUCHAT: No.
WARREN: How do the risks of a child responding negatively to a vaccination compare with the risks of skipping vaccinations and risking exposure to a deadly disease?
SCHUCHAT: Vaccines are safe and highly effective, and its important for parents to know that theyre the best way to protect their kids.
WARREN: So I think every parent wants to protect their children, and parents should know that all of the credible scientific evidence suggests that modern vaccines are safe, modern vaccines are effective, and modern vaccines are our best chance of protecting our children from diseases that can kill them. Is that right?
SCHUCHAT: Thats right.
WARREN: Thank you.
Every statement made by Dr. Schuchat was and is supported by a mountain of evidence. Of course, our friends at the Age of Not Caring about Autism have decided to publish their own questions using ignorance, lies, science denialism, cherry picking, appeals to authority, and general gibberish to mock Senator Warren. Except one of our best Senators, and one of the leading authorities, experts, and leaders of public health say that vaccines are critical human health.
I know that this doesn't shut the door on this fake debate. If it did, I'd give all of my money to Senator Warren's future campaigns (if I only were a Koch brother, but the liberal younger black sheep version).
Let me try to make this as un-snarky as I can. Dr. Schuchat is a brilliant public health specialist. Her job, her life, and her noble calling is to protect everyone in the world, including children, adults, whatever nationality, whatever class. She is a rear admiral in the US Public Health Service, a group whose whole purpose is to serve the health of the nation (with military officer salaries, not exactly a way to buying a new Ferrari). They are independent from the politics of the USA, and are considered to be the finest public health officials in the world. If they thought that vaccines harmed anyone in the world, they would be the first to say ""let's look at this and see if there's something that should be done.""
The CDC (which has a lot of US Public Health Service officers) takes years to add vaccines to the schedule. Why? Because they demand outstanding research. So the vaccine schedule authorized by the CDC is not a statement issued by a bunch of bureaucrats, but is a living document that evolves with new data. Their knowledge of science and the evidence behind vaccines is beyond reproach. When one of their officers or leaders says ""vaccines are safe and highly effective,"" then to contradict that, you need to bring real evidence with real science published in real journals. Inventing strawman arguments like ""Big Pharma pays off the CDC"" is inane and absurd. It shows ignorance of the highest level.
So, let me repeat, thanks to Senator Warren and Dr. SchuchatVACCINES SAVES LIVES.",32,67,20.761194029850746,0,0.5836352774393604,0.32588789107200117,0.12841249941598756,0.12143986207842578,0.208955223880597,0.40846310686320064,0.3772222451262911,0.21082744202705928,0.2601246731580053,0.23416124739839386,0.19963792420323354,0.11030988785947633,0.12929198377972462,0.080674864790093,0.6969836857104088,0.1380677585954528,0.08956195236620475,0.7733523579867226,0.15200724425111553,0.1552333490402465,1.318112124070942,0.2620120402816475,0.15371235881966522,1.3187840026329676,0.2633658719261695,0.026438492063492063,0.011881868131868131,0.043478260869565216,0.022038980509745128,3.1207327968155596,3.5486731763104795,0,0,1.1606339134116912,6.509726469325865,9.251309802043053,1.6091418639693615,1.4660908635446348,-0.3313954943859233,,-0.4002651895115172,-0.7334161934761665,-0.938683052095277,-0.9897226235069742,0.045324210231297256,0.6724161040172518,0.4457459127336873,-0.26533942002515243,-0.6083177443039228,0.42534984878384163,0.16924260920321296,-0.37228319762514084,-1.1097203907654283,-0.3551727472787183,-0.2934357768038598,-0.3263343301248742,-1.4828140185648035,-1.4489897328782513,-1.514864121938399,-0.23510990067852866,-0.34016344169465734,-0.4526047959721855,-0.5681381094368031,-0.38335746821821914,-0.4440906934915886,-0.11274114774134152,-0.6720574572469711,0.1887040306745328,-0.8285108682924386,-0.43039933457280355,-0.2387300368996825,,,0.2675329693925608,-0.1815349510838086,-0.2033841290796714,0,0.18286586291198828
110,yes_183.txt,"Vaccine exemptions a public threat: Reader
As a family physician, I always look forward to serving as Doctor-of-the-Day for the Mississippi Legislature, courtesy of our Mississippi State Medical Association. However, what I dont look forward to is if House Bill 130 allowing a parent or guardian to claim an exemption from a vaccine for conscientious objection or philosophical belief that vaccines cause harm passes is treating the myriad complications of measles, mumps, rubella, and chicken pox: pneumonia, encephalitis, meningitis, deafness, orchitis, pancreatitis, premature births, eye defects, heart malformations, neurologic problems to name a few.
Mississippi, a leader in protecting its children through vaccination, is one of 31 states which reject philosophical exemptions for children attending school or day care. As a matter of fact, because of recent deadly outbreaks of measles and whooping cough, Washington, Oregon, California, and Vermont (states that allowed philosophical exemptions) have now tightened their exemption rules.
Make no mistake. Deadly diseases still threaten children as well as others around them who cannot be immunized like newborn infants, those with special medical conditions, and older adults at higher risk for complications. Repeated scientific testing has established that immunizations are both safe and effective. It is disingenuous that a group of parents philosophically opposed would place at risk an entire generation and thrust us back into the dark ages of medicine.",4,9,29.666666666666668,0,0.6683849357068539,0.5738409865233634,0.44662240395943326,0.450927060097456,0.8888888888888888,0.33320924471176805,0.34084132258443656,0.3099208126918206,0.26444499628500096,0.13913278867091453,0.166591785065991,0.1537204701388772,0.11367373686535137,0.12420096374224303,1.081422595930677,0.2134611786917523,0.11228653515847353,0.9733541572952757,0.19318940845725893,0.14783137320445994,1.2881268265850532,0.25414657223767056,0.15150678367108805,1.3046848443442063,0.2597090068430712,0.011904761904761904,0.018849206349206348,0,0.0380952380952381,3.1397119018228126,3.535073727503107,0,0,1.146983225108225,7.492323648123161,9.830715423174675,-1.2192785145041007,-1.0396681306946025,1.4366235090905752,,0.32042747824240436,1.2341630096099627,1.9421543597273907,2.0447898099091,2.738488006233872,-1.2976011609841775,-0.7257146108528264,0.6713755586423042,-0.539332157399896,-2.6632512459911335,-1.509275245324325,0.36744542888523496,-1.5086012956542505,0.6880935536633376,0.8346269014748752,0.7680570299740599,-0.5350312937944742,-0.42804682063442745,-0.47427603155374737,-1.0192782980677788,-0.9417895798714967,-1.1263845903276188,-0.8702508843685105,-0.6965956315845885,-0.8311098988150797,-0.5951374539121921,-0.43801934975334766,-1.1385573984231125,0.05293074080690062,-0.1613318505916828,-0.46217386950631295,,,-0.013061880559671328,3.0071531784686862,1.8256356645244554,0,3.1434764899062477
111,yes_184.txt,"Vaccinations, a problem harder than it should be
Measles was declared eradicated in the U.S. in 2000, but now we are having annual outbreaks, the current one traced to a single tourist at Disney World. Vaccinations are the only practical means we have to stop the spread, and therein lies the controversy.
While there are communities with 100 percent of entering kindergartners immunized, that drops off the closer you get to California, both geographically and philosophically. Parents, many of them educated and economically comfortable, withhold their children from immunization and hope that other people's children will protect theirs. ""Herd immunity,"" which reduces exposure to diseases, requires 95 percent immunized, and the country as a whole stands at 91 percent. Immunizations become a social obligation in a society that is losing interest in obligations as witness the rise in red-light runners and hit-and-run accidents.
These parents aren't dumb, but they are scared the ""But what if they're right?"" factor is very powerful when your chief concern is your own precious child. These parents never saw a child with measles, mumps, chickenpox, whooping cough or polio. They have only vague notions of the consequences of these formerly common diseases, and you can't blame them for that. They cautiously look to authority, but the CDC performed so badly with the Ebola virus problem that it lost a lot of credibility. That leaves Jenny McCarthy as a prominent source of information. ""She advises against immunizations, you know, and she used to be on 'The View' or something.""
Politicians, in particular those looking toward the presidential nominations, were quick to contribute to the confusion. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said that vaccinations should be mostly voluntary. He is an ophthalmologist and a politician, not likely to be reading general-interest medical journals, and who was obtuse enough to talk about smallpox vaccinations as an example of what some people legitimately might not want. Routine smallpox vaccinations ended in the USA in 1971; the virus was eradicated in the world by 1980, due to the immunization campaign, and Rand seems blissfully unaware. He backed off the next day, talking out of both sides of his mouth at the same time, as did Gov. Christie. They hoped voters will only remember the statements they agreed with, which is fairly likely.
I read a statement by a physician that immunizations have never been proven to save a single life. That's total and irresponsible nonsense, but it got his name in the papers. Everyone has his own motivations, not just politicians. Take me, for instance.
From the time smallpox vaccination was first proposed until today, there have always been people to claim whatever innovation was under consideration was actually a plot to harm others: Authorities in Africa tell people it was invented by white people to kill black people; immunizations cause impotence and infertility; measles vaccines, and others, cause ""autism and other mental disorders,"" and should be voluntary. People desperately need reliable information.
Unfortunately, the swine flu vaccine in the 1970s really did cause harm. It was new and inadequately tested, but was used because public health officials believed we were heading for a 1918-like influenza pandemic, a worldwide disaster. They believed there was no time to wait, and it poisoned the well for public opinion in the future. In a society with little trust in the government in the first place, that's hard to overcome.
But we can depend on Sen. Paul for confusion and Jenny McCarthy for misinformation, so it's not like we have been abandoned altogether.
The surgeon general and I hope you will choose immunization for your family.

112,yes_185.txt,"Few vaccination rules for teachers amid measles outbreak
CHRISTINE ARMARIO
ASSOCIATED PRESS
February 16, 2015
LOS ANGELES While much of the attention in the ongoing measles outbreak has focused on student vaccination requirements and exemptions, less attention has been paid to another group in the nation's classrooms: Teachers and staff members, who, by and large, are not required to be vaccinated.
In most states, there is no law dictating which vaccines teachers and school staff workers are required to get. Some states provide a list of recommended vaccines, but there is no requirement or follow-up for teachers to receive them.
So when a measles case surfaced at a California high school, it was easy for officials to review student records, but there were no immunization records on file for employees.
That meant all 24 teachers and staff exposed to the employee with measles had to prove their immunity records that, for most, were decades old.
The issue has surfaced from time to time in state legislatures and is likely to be raised again in response to the latest outbreak, which originated at Disneyland in December and has spread to a half dozen states and Mexico. Most of those who fell ill were not vaccinated. As of Friday, public health officials said 114 people had contracted measles.
""I was definitely shocked,"" Rep. Joanna Cole, a Democrat in the Vermont Legislature, said when she learned in 2012 that there were no teacher vaccination requirements in her state. There are still no requirements today. ""I guess we all just assumed that they would have them.""
Cole and other legislators and parents across the U.S. believe the blanket presumption that teachers are up to date on their vaccines should be re-examined. They note that most of those sickened in the current outbreak are adults, and that schools are one of the top places for the spread of communicable disease.
""I will be surprised if we don't see some changes in the next year to year and a half,"" said Kristen Amundson, executive director of the National Association of School Boards of Education.
Already, some states are considering measles legislation. In Vermont, Democratic Rep. George Till says legislators will try this year to eliminate philosophical exemptions for students and require that teachers be up to date on the same vaccines students must receive.
""If we're trying to limit the spread in school, why just students?"" Till said. A similar bill he introduced in 2012 was defeated amid strong opposition from anti-vaccine groups, and he expects another battle.
In Colorado, pro-vaccination groups have been pushing the Department of Human Services to require vaccinations for workers at child care facilities, another area with uneven employee immunization standards. Measles cases have been confirmed at day care facilities in Chicago and Santa Monica, California.
Barbara Loe Fisher, director of the National Vaccine Information Center, a Virginia-based nonprofit that favors letting parents decide whether to vaccinate, said the discussion on vaccination requirements has started to expand from schoolchildren to certain adult professions. She said her organization has a number of concerns about requiring teacher vaccinations, including safety and job protection for those who cannot or choose not to be immunized.
""I think at the end of the day, the most important principle to protect is the right to make an informed voluntary decision, and that includes teachers,"" she said.
At Vista Murrieta High School in California's Riverside County, a middle class community between Los Angeles and San Diego, all teachers and staff who had been exposed to the measles were able to return to work within one to three days. Teachers who were born before 1957 were immediately excused, assuming they had either had gotten measles as a child or been exposed to the disease.
Kathy Ericson, president of the Murrieta Teachers Association, said the instructors were willing to do ""whatever needs to be done"" to protect students. But she stopped short of saying whether vaccination or proof of immunization should be required for employment.
""Most of us don't have our shot records,"" she said. ""It would be a hard thing to go back and prove.""
Several parents with students in Murrieta Valley schools said they believed it was important for teachers to show proof of immunity or get vaccinated to protect their children and others too young or vulnerable to get the vaccines themselves.
""It is everyone's responsibility to keep students healthy and safe,"" said Sherrie Zettlemoyer, the mother of two elementary-school students. ""I believe if you can be vaccinated you should.""

113,yes_186.txt,"'Religious' objections to vaccinations? There really aren't any
In the national debate over immunizing children, much has been said about ""religious objections"" to vaccines claimed by parents. Finding a religion whose tenets object to the practice, however, is difficult.
The number of students receiving vaccination exemptions for any reason is relatively small, the Federal Centers for Disease Control reported. Surveying the 2012-13 school year, the agency reported, ""an estimated 91,453 exemptions were reported among a total estimated population of 4,242,558 kindergartners, roughly 2 percent of the nation's newest students.
But many of these exemptions, the CDC reports, are for philosophical reasons. California, for example, reported 14,921 philosophical exemptions in 2012 and zero religious ones, while Illinois reported 8,082 religious exemptions and none on philosophical grounds.
And while the question of personal objections to vaccinations remains a hot topic, one aspect seems to be indisputable: No major religion explicitly objects to immunization. The Deseret News identified one faith, with approximately 12,000 members, that has a tenet explicitly rejecting injections or vaccines of any kind.
But the world's major faiths Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism and Islam have no explicit prohibitions against oral or injected vaccines. At times, some followers or preachers within a given religion or sect may have spoken against vaccination, but researcher John D. Grabenstein of Merck Vaccines, writing in the scientific journal Vaccine in April 2013, could find no sustained teaching against the practice in any major faith community.
In fact, Grabenstein wrote, ""multiple religious doctrines or imperatives call for preservation of life, caring for others, and duty to community (e.g., parent to child, neighbors to each other).""
In an interview, Grabenstein said many religious objections were ""about safety concerns, not about theology, (even though) people who went to a church, or mosque or synagogue, said 'I'm not going to get a vaccine because of my religion.'""
Mark S. Movsesian, a law professor at St. John's University in Queens, New York, who specializes in religious liberty issues, agrees.
""The people who are claiming these exemptions, it's not religious exemption, but 'personal belief,'"" he said. ""My impression is, that's what most of the objection is about.""
Writing on the website for First Things magazine, Movsesian also denied that conscience exemptions could be blamed on the 2014 Hobby Lobby decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. Instead, he noted, the Hobby Lobby majority opinion specifically excluded vaccines from such conscience protections.
Not Christian Scientists
While members of the Christian Science Church are noted for relying on spiritual healing, the organization does not list a formal policy against immunizations on its website.
Church founder Mary Baker Eddy said in 1901 that members should comply with vaccination mandates, according to Boston College history professor Alan Rogers, whose 2014 book ""The Child Cases: How Americas Religious Exemption Laws Harm Children,"" examined legal cases involving children in the movement.
Because Eddy, who died in 1910, has spoken on the subject, Rogers said, ""the (Christian Science) Church took no official position against vaccination. But, since the central belief of the Scientists was that there was no material reality, that the human body was a manifestation of God's perfect spiritual world, there was no need for vaccination. Indeed, to choose vaccination would be to deny that religious 'reality.'""
A spokesperson for The First Church of Christ, Scientist, was not immediately available for comment.
One religious group that explicitly forbids vaccinations, surgeries, medicine and anything invasive is the New Jersey-based Congregation of Universal Wisdom, founded by 71-year-old chiropractor Walter P. Schilling. He said the group has ""11,600 members in 48 states and a couple of foreign countries."" On its website, the group classifies as ""sacrilege"" the ""injection into the body of medication or other matter of substances that defy natural law.""
""The immunization thing isn't the driving force, it's about keeping the body pure,"" Schilling said. ""We're looking for the natural, innate ability of the body to heal itself.""
The group's beliefs have withstood legal challenge. In 2002, Kelly Turner, a Congregation of Universal Wisdom adherent, had her objections to immunizing her daughter recognized as religious by the federal District Court in Syracuse, New York, despite school authorities' contention that it wasn't a bona fide religious belief.
Exemption repeal pondered
While 20 states allow some measure of personal belief exemption, continuing instances of disease outbreaks related to unvaccinated children have caused legislators to re-examine the doctrine.
California state Sen. Richard Pan, a pediatrician and Democrat from Sacramento, introduced a bill this week that would repeal that state's personal belief exemption, the one used by nearly 15,000 kindergartner's parents in 2012.
""As a pediatrician, Ive been worried about the anti-vaccination trend for a long time,"" Pan said in a statement. ""Ive personally witnessed the suffering caused by these preventable diseases, and I am very grateful to the many parents that are now speaking up and letting us know that our current laws dont protect their kids.""
In 2012, Pan sponsored, and the Legislature passed, a bill requiring those who claim a vaccination exemption to talk with a ""licensed health care practitioner"" about potential impacts in their communities. That bill cut personal exemptions by 20 percent in its first year, Pan said, but some California communities still have opt-out rates of more than 10 percent, which endangers others at risk for infection.
Health advocates stress the issue is one of community protection and not a religious rights conflict.
""There's not two sides of the story,"" said Diane Peterson, associate director of the Immunization Action Coalition in St. Paul, Minnesota. ""There's the side that 95 percent of the nation support and then there's the hardcore (of people who) never met a vaccine they liked.""

114,yes_187.txt,"Charles Kenny / U.S. lags many countries on child vaccines
The U.S. measles outbreak has shone a light on the growing number of parents opting not to vaccinate their children, despite overwhelming medical reasons to do so. Amid the often-vicious debate between anti-vaxxers and their critics, it's gone largely unnoticed that when it comes to vaccination rates, the U.S. is out of step with the rest of the world.
Recently, a group of donors that included the U.S., Britain and the Gates Foundation met in Germany to pledge $7.5 billion to Gavi, the vaccine alliance, to pay for its operations to 2020. Gavi is a global organization that buys vaccines to immunize children in low-income countries. The alliance has provided billions of dollars' worth of new vaccines over the past decade for such conditions as haemophilus influenza and pneumococcal disease, both of which can cause pneumonia and meningitis, as well as rotavirus - the leading global cause of death due to diarrhea under age 5. Gavi support has translated into more kids being protected against catching and spreading these killer illnesses.
Some Gavi resources have gone toward buying vaccines that even the poorest countries were already providing before they got donor support - including immunizations against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus. The very fact that many of the world's poorest countries are already immunizing against a number of diseases, including measles, and that ""middle income"" countries are providing a growing spectrum of vaccines without any donor support at all, is a demonstration of the level of global commitment against infectious disease that should shame America. Average health expenditures per person per year - public and private combined - are as low as $20 in some of the poorest countries that receive Gavi support and remain below $100 in such countries as Nigeria and India. Despite tight resource constraints, those countries are providing the staff and equipment to run national vaccination programs at a cost of $20 a child or more - mostly with minimal donor assistance (which is focused on providing the vaccines themselves).
Thanks to this global commitment, alongside U.S. domestic backsliding, America is now a laggard in world tables of basic vaccination. Nine percent of U.S. children aren't immunized against measles - that's a higher proportion than in Tajikistan, Zimbabwe, Bhutan, Libya and 106 other countries. In some U.S. communities, vaccination rates are low enough that the risk of a local epidemic is considerable. In 2014, a large measles outbreak occurred among unvaccinated Amish communities in Ohio, for example, traced back to a victim who had visited the Philippines during a measles outbreak there. The Philippines is one of the minority of countries worldwide with an even lower measles immunization rate than the U.S. - 10 percent of children aren't vaccinated on schedule.
It isn't just with measles that the U.S. lags the world. America is 115th worldwide in terms of Hepatitis B vaccination, according to World Health Organization data, with one-tenth of 1-year-olds not immunized. Six percent of U.S. kids aren't vaccinated against whooping cough - that's higher than Serbia, Burundi, Mongolia, and 89 other countries. And that's why U.S. whooping cough cases in 2012 were at their highest level since 1955 - 48,277 infected and 20 related deaths, some of which were among infants too young to be vaccinated.
In the developing world, the spread of immunization coverage has been a central part of declining illness and child deaths - the number of measles deaths globally has fallen from half a million to 100,000 in the 12 years from 2000, for example. And by considerably reducing the chance that an American travelling abroad will come back with hepatitis B, measles or whooping cough, developing countries are also making lives safer for the vaccine deniers, immune-suppressed infants and the allergic in the U.S.
Given its atrocious standing in the vaccination tables, America should be grateful for the better efforts of much poorer countries to roll out immunizations - and should redouble its support for their fight against infectious disease through vehicles like Gavi. If we want the luxury of denying science and allowing people the choice to expose others to risk, it's even more important we ensure that other countries are building global immunity and reducing that risk for us all.

What, if any, changes should be made to Minnesota's laws governing immunizations?
Some changes in the immunization laws might be necessary.
All of my children were vaccinated. It's common sense. If parents insist on being ignorant, the state could withhold welfare benefits and approval for permits for foreign immigrants.
Other than that, there isn't much the state can do.

116,yes_189.txt,"In Our View: Immunize
Measles is a highly contagious disease that many younger physicians have never seen. It would have been nice if it had stayed that way.
Sometimes we pay a price for our freedoms, and we have to wonder if the price society is now paying for the freedom exercised by those who choose not to immunize their children is too high.
In Utah, vaccinations are not mandatory. They are strongly encouraged but no child will be prevented from going to school simply because they haven't been immunized. According to Utah law, parents can fill out a form where they declare they have a personal belief opposed to immunizations, or that the person ""is a bona fide member of a specified, recognized religious organization whose teachings are contrary to immunizations."" There is also a medical exemption for those with childhood diseases like leukemia or with compromised immune systems for whom vaccinations are not possible.
All of which leaves the potential to have a sizable portion of a school's population vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles.
It then takes just one sick student to start an outbreak.
The lives jeopardized by such an outbreak are not just those of the children whose parents chose not to vaccinate; they put every student in the school at risk. Admittedly, vaccines are not 100 percent effective, but when an entire community vaccinates, ""herd immunity"" prevents a disease like measles from being able to spread. When a significant number of the herd chooses not to participate, the entire group becomes vulnerable.
Without significant participation in immunizations, it takes very little to lose control of very preventable illnesses.
We saw a dramatic example of this when an outbreak of measles started at Disneyland.
There was a time where people believed vaccines were linked to autism and other developmental issues, but those fears have long since been debunked. Numerous studies have since proven that there is no link between autism and immunizations. Even Autism Speaks has since published its position in favor of immunizing children.
Vaccines are readily available and covered by most insurances and as such, there is no reason any parent should not vaccinate their child and follow through on getting the booster shots as recommended by physicians.
Those who insist on choosing not to vaccinate despite the clear risks to the rest of society and the overwhelming evidence of the efficacy and safety of immunizations should seek to find alternatives to public school for their children. Freedom of choice comes with a price. Perhaps only those exercising it should pay it.",12,22,21.363636363636363,0,0.6352253433738259,0.43623311458421604,0.16614313535521635,0.155988694977067,0.045454545454545456,0.37724631950083487,0.36164357433984595,0.22681858016988607,0.3507506253352702,0.22448636886646162,0.20164181651699842,0.12769789972101098,0.22972543701189496,0.09056593397717135,0.7404887226310151,0.15129233254366944,0.14234785766746003,1.1801310507145746,0.2382292809379057,0.1598146782197984,1.3643940465838864,0.27346112722544236,0.1705873040963958,1.3842420367904547,0.28064026548762344,0.005555555555555555,0.009259259259259259,0,0.04612159329140461,3.0383637850599032,3.4797684114993817,0,0,1.1084762235176764,6.236091227936866,9.278797005489468,-0.4111584063688258,-0.4780324940547735,-0.2117915678937599,,0.038445514554785676,0.1422049257008387,-0.597097746189908,-0.671534652559205,-0.6022891238628917,-0.14478594121449956,-0.055885067494354526,-0.11417755597875061,0.8387695026243971,0.1108983589282041,0.2710266334499111,-0.07598654697683578,1.4552913500522784,-0.11809615618542325,-0.16577854138209794,-0.134369839703407,0.7187475948309348,0.6274807020282233,0.6637883659655278,0.2502380172750653,0.5884387948503115,0.5281586377378787,1.7433390341384836,1.0709105084317356,1.384120606810133,-0.8058771371540653,-0.7601528529482947,-1.1385573984231125,0.49355418008854185,-1.5981479055742371,-1.3708600924872145,,,-0.8045872669144976,-1.0695259456359434,-0.10712672696011485,0,2.134971500363599
117,yes_19.txt,"Treat vaccination exemption as the public act it is
Californias measles outbreak has touched off a debate about how to tighten state laws that make it easy for parents to choose in defiance of all credible public health information not to vaccinate their children. Newly introduced state legislation would eliminate the Personal Belief Exemptions that thousands of parents have used to avoid school vaccination requirements.
Id be more than happy to see this proposal become law. But the politics of reducing parental choice are fraught, and there are limits to the laws ability to compel good parenting. Theres also cultural reality: few things are more Californian than the freedom to believe the pseudo-religious or pseudo-scientific nonsense of your choice. So its likely parents will still find ways to avoid vaccinating their children.
So instead of targeting the choice of anti-vaccine parents, why not target the secrecy that surrounds that choice?
Under todays privacy laws, school and health authorities must protect the identity of parents who choose not to vaccinate. Thats wrong. Parents who endanger the communitys health dont deserve official protection. And the confidentiality of such exemptions makes it harder for communities to protect themselves.
After all, a parent who wont vaccinate is not making a private family decision: She is making a public health decision that profoundly affects others.
So lets treat the exemption as the public act it is. Require a public body (city council or school board) to approve each exemption in a public session. And make each exempt parents name and address available on the Internet via a public registry.
The virtues of disclosure are clear. Having your familys name published as a potential hazard to public health would be a powerful incentive for all but the most committed anti-vaxxers to vaccinate their kids. And the rest of us would be able to identify our unvaccinated neighbors. This would be especially helpful to pregnant women and the parents of children who are either too young to be vaccinated or have serious diseases like cancer that compromise immune systems and preclude vaccination.
In effect, the question of how to handle unvaccinated children and their parents would move from the realm of school administrators to the community at large. And the community level is where the question is best addressed, since we encounter the unvaccinated not only at school but also in parks, churches and stores.
There would be some risk of conflict in this shift (and any harassment must not be tolerated). But there would also be potential for the kind of conversations necessary to change minds and get more children vaccinated.
Those who have studied the question of how to persuade people to vaccinate report that the warnings of distant authorities health departments, governors, President Obama arent particularly effective. People you know neighbors, friends, co-workers make better emissaries to the unvaccinated. But you can only be an emissary to unvaccinated neighbors if you know they are unvaccinated.
Some committed opponents of vaccines may howl about their identities being made public, but such objections are easily turned against them. If you believe you have the power to make whatever decision you want for your children, why would you deny me the right to do the same, including the right to decide whether my children should be playing at the homes of people who have recklessly opted out of modernity?
That response may sound insufficiently sensitive to privacy. But for better and for worse, it fits the obligations of 21st century child rearing. As a parent myself, Im repeatedly reminded by all manner of officials and all the legal waivers that daily life requires me to sign that I am required to know everything I can about my kids where they are at all times, who they hang out with, and all their online movements. Why should this be any different?
This issue is personal. My own children are still little, and it will be a few more years before all three are old enough to have had all their vaccinations. It bothers me that, according to media-compiled data on vaccine exemptions, three of the 95 kids who attend our local kindergarten with my oldest son are unvaccinated because their parents have obtained Personal Belief Exemptions.
I should have the right to know who those families are. And I look forward to the day when I can engage them in conversation about what our families owe each other.",15,38,21.657894736842106,0,0.5723469374147622,0.3821796294987986,0.36101336355010666,0.36019508929716215,0.10526315789473684,0.38098896829330403,0.3735091118196842,0.34887425449526654,0.35842423111102006,0.22441913551934387,0.2060141369366044,0.190300561730291,0.21390843676535762,0.1298659929641204,1.1066550426059842,0.22036928853121518,0.16917725162992872,1.308355930038251,0.26911318729638956,0.16644172973468443,1.3699966577277485,0.27506263688754956,0.16382009407368922,1.3631958979099428,0.27346482772757685,0.03551136363636364,0.05974025974025974,0.034482758620689655,0.030303030303030304,3.0316236389393434,3.4743109430521244,0,0,1.1649258498315103,6.442645930384617,8.984150128405958,-0.10811336581809766,0.21321136642501615,-0.15337194021346584,,-0.4962587787855105,-0.2867250415366781,1.1671133478667608,1.209166164568155,-0.36539191167512874,-0.04680980381487722,0.3261835491762487,1.0395966834578165,0.9612992724007513,0.10871315049386775,0.49311060699806447,0.9907805580106608,1.0513344011350882,0.8238772380117537,0.9086667049894672,0.8683333632835988,1.837731223535278,1.2820262219755965,1.4441607859365735,0.9523106099359913,0.700849795867544,0.6653488017255309,0.816387803379266,0.6033326747861592,0.6247181796939175,0.18840107007304,0.9355417507036022,-0.08590178224222138,-0.37483869040885864,-1.6937032100857559,-1.4605282609150303,,,0.35575527942932705,-0.39922224233753917,-1.1389502438919141,0,7.339788560447201

119,yes_191.txt,"Feldman: Doubts over vaccine safety persist
Resistance to vaccination continues.
Studies show that half of parents have concerns about the safety of vaccines, and 25 percent believe that vaccines cause autism. The doubts continue despite the fact that numerous studies in the mainstream medical literature have demonstrated that immunizations are safe and effective and have no connections to autism. The most recent study, published in the Journal of Pediatrics, involved more than 1,000 children. It found no relationship between vaccines and the risk of developing autism regardless of the number of immunizations given at one time or in total by age 2.
Our immunization rates have suffered, specifically in communities that, for various religious and philosophical reasons, are anti-vaccine. Even in some states, most notably California, immunization rates are so low that the ""herd immunity"" of the entire population is at risk for certain diseases. High immunization rates are required to maintain the collective protective effect of vaccines.
There is no better example of this problem than the current measles outbreak originating at Disneyland and now escalating to 141 cases in 17 states.
The scenario is typical: An unimmunized international visitor to the U.S. spreads the infection to other unvaccinated people at a specific location. They in turn spread the infection primarily to other unimmunized individuals, particularly if they return home to communities with inadequate immunization rates. Innocent people, some infants too young to be vaccinated, become at risk for serious illness and even death.
The public's fears regarding the measles vaccine were principally fueled years ago by completely fraudulent research linking the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine to autism. The infamous 1998 Lancet journal study was conducted by lead author Dr. Andrew Wakefield in London.
Wakefield betrayed the world, his profession, and devastated parents looking for a cause of their child's autism. Every sordid detail of the research hoax was documented in extensive investigative reports published in the British Medical Journal. Lancet eventually retracted Wakefield's paper in humiliation, and Wakefield was totally discredited and lost his British medical license.
Why did he write such trash? Greed. The investigations uncovered that Wakefield was funded by an attorney planning to use the study in a suit against MMR vaccine manufacturers. And during his research, Wakefield applied for patents for a diagnostic test to identify the fictional MMR-associated autistic syndrome.
The development of vaccines is among the greatest medical miracles of the 20th-century, changing the world forever. No longer do young healthy people commonly die of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. A century ago, this was an unfortunate fact of everyday life.
The gravestones of people who died long ago bear the names and ages of young people who died of these diseases like measles, diphtheria, polio, tetanus, smallpox, and meningitis that are rare or non-existent today.
Most Americans, particularly young parents without memory of the devastating infectious diseases that once consumed our communities, may have little appreciation for vaccines and their importance to the common good. Misleading information in the media and on the Internet about the necessity and safety of immunizations has unfortunately diffused widely into the broad perception of the general public.
I often wonder if anti-vaccine parents would risk not immunizing their children if Ebola became rampant in the U.S and a vaccine was actually available. Would they vaccinate if polio returned to America? Of course, that situation is theoretically possible given outbreaks abroad and today's worldwide travel.
Vaccines have saved millions of lives over the past century. Unfortunately, some cannot appreciate what they do not see and as a result put their communities at risk.

120,yes_21.txt,"Vaccine expert reveals why thimerosal (mercury) is NOT needed in vaccines
(NaturalNews) Want a ""shot of truth"" instead of poison? Sounds like a good choice, considering the shot of truth can heal you, help you, and prevent disease and infection. A shot of truth can even cure disease, but that cannot be printed on any product label. Still, nobody wants to suffer, so why on Earth do so many millions let doctors talk them into it -- suffering that is -- and why let the nurses and physicians inject a known neurotoxin and carcinogen into their muscle tissue?
The contention is that vaccines are 100% safe all of the time, no matter how many you get or how frequently. The ""fear"" is injected into hundreds of millions, that the human body is weak and susceptible, in dire need of vaccines in order to protect itself from deadly viruses. The horror of dying from an infectious disease is in the back of everyone's mind, except for a few doctors who are ""blowing the whistle"" on this monster tragedy -- of injecting a deadly toxin into the body for NO good reason. How can Western Medicine be SO wrong about something so important? Are you scared to death or being injected with slow death, or both?
Frank B. Engley, Jr., PhD, was videotaped as part of a documentary film called about autism and mercury because, during the past two decades, the frequency of autism occurring in children has skyrocketed from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 68. How much mercury really is in the tetanus shot? What about typical flu shots? How many of these autism cases relate directly to this phenomenon?
Back in May of 2008, you may have missed the Autism One conference and an 88-year-old doctor speaking about his life of dedication to the field of microbiology, having served as a trusted consultant to the CDC, FDA, NASA and the CIA. He served as council for the NIH's Infectious Disease division. He is brave enough to reveal to the public now that thimerosal is toxic down to ""parts per billion"" and that he discovered this way back in 1948. He has blown the whistle by informing parents of thimerosal-injured children, the same children who were injected during their first days of life on Earth.
Thimerosal is ""Not Effective""
In Dr. Frank Engley's words, ""Some of the studies that we did show that the thimerosal in these biologicals is not effective. I went into a number of refrigerators and took samples of biologicals and I found 5 or 6% or more contaminated with pathogens, and they were sitting there -- going to be used again. So thimerosal is not a real, effective preservative. Now, the question about the use of it -- why is it used -- is to protect the biologicals from the poor techniques of the physicians or nurses who are going to be taking samples out of multi-dose vials, and that's the real catch there. It's a problem for only multi-dose vials.""
Dr. Engley goes on to say, ""Microorganisms, unlike humans, can stay viable -- can stay alive -- if moisture is taken away from them, if food is taken away from them, if the temperature is lowered, the organism will just lie there, and just wait, and can stay for days and weeks, and even months, waiting for the moisture to come back, the food to come back, the temperature to be proper, and then the organism can grow out again.""

Another prominent physician blows the whistle on mercury-loaded vaccines
Also, Dr. Mark Geier has an MD and PhD in genetics and has worked for a decade at the NIH. He was a professor at Johns Hopkins University, and he describes autoimmune system disorders like Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) as your body attacking its own nerves and says the CDC has published numbers that show 17,000 cases of GBS for every million people injected with influenza inoculations. He's quoted saying, ""First, let's start with the indisputable facts: the seasonal flu vaccine causees Guillain-Barre Syndrome... If you go to an emergency room with sudden onset of GBS symptoms, the first question the doctors will ask you is: 'Did you recently get the flu shot?'"" You see, the most doctors know the truth, but they can never say, if they want to keep their licenses to practice ""medicine.""

Have you seen too many horrifying pictures of kids with polio or small pox? A picture of a child who died from vaccine toxins wouldn't make things any better.

That's the case in late 2014, when the flu virus appears to be spreading faster and far more furiously than usual. Norfolk, according to measures by WebMD, is the fifth-sickest city in America.
For any number of reasons, the flu is always bad news. The infection itself can be horrible, even deadly. Already, two young children in Eastern Virginia have died this fall.
Countless children and adults have been taken ill, some of them sick enough to require hospitalization.
This year, the vaccine designed in February missed the mark for the virus infecting us in December. Seventy percent of this winter's flu cases have been the result of infection with an H3N2 strain slightly different from the one in the vaccine.
The result is inconsistent immunity in vaccine recipients. Some folks have been entirely saved the indignities of an infection; others have suffered as completely as if they hadn't been inoculated at all.
The vaccine's ineffectiveness hurts more than just the millions who received a useless shot. It means there's a lot less protection in the population, the so-called ""herd immunity"" necessary to keep a virus like influenza from spreading.
The influenza virus mutates readily and has myriad forms. Scientists preparing the vaccine are always forecasting which strain will spread months later. An analysis of how this year's prediction and outbreak diverged should help improve next year's process. In the end, though, it's hard to predict the future with unerring accuracy.
The rest of us can do our part, and not just by washing our hands and covering our mouths and staying home when we're sick.
Vaccines are the best prevention available against any number of viruses, including the once-devastating diseases of childhood: polio, pertussis, measles. Compared with influenza, those viruses are relatively stable, and the vaccines well-targeted.
Despite this year's trials with the flu virus, decades of experience show that vaccines work. Even flu vaccines work - most years. And they all work better when everyone gets a shot.",17,29,16.17241379310345,0,0.675047725971256,0.4102130489552329,0.20438524262577878,0.19784478090849578,0.0,0.4214281959666146,0.3402347360808483,0.15573345300896713,0.26451147108310075,0.21295569402476153,0.18010756487953633,0.11728925642091781,0.14112530612603288,0.06187969922059747,0.5311678922488352,0.10457957755496311,0.09996672622737335,0.8585750961446201,0.16946707161461927,0.155339282838677,1.329772609361829,0.26404535046033745,0.15536962918372726,1.3339112662575945,0.26396858179290283,0.05,0.07857142857142857,0.06666666666666667,0.025120772946859903,3.1680912418839324,3.595275243970098,0,0,1.1565714704312609,6.66771317850085,9.673849037775767,0.09391666121572108,-0.17561330509486553,-1.2424140323360169,,0.3770863980362861,-0.06427178676499125,-0.2508819566781446,-0.286048315194084,-0.7823310051255915,1.0118199385289033,-0.7452466098634754,-0.7861347507479111,-0.5382707083308238,-0.26386995170704747,-0.8227660697537554,-0.25335277907798714,-0.8075042488889203,-0.8056694224077564,-0.7799906054137,-0.8124400930592142,-1.048858200281861,-1.0139558942572013,-1.0736904059654113,-0.2238872300311868,-0.10620702561689041,-0.27842529306165886,-0.341130406334118,-0.047278095429411034,-0.38030373707860304,0.6693006455390477,1.568094811522771,0.8965767928599436,-0.6593294715555713,0.24100311854263734,0.5269586871619688,,,0.18402798025264247,0.3311576914800071,1.2763054728292418,0,-2.434418605040476

It is a cause for concern that as many as 2.7m Nigerian kids were not vaccinated against measles
For an alarmingly great number of newborn babies in the country, the undesirable possibility of measles infection is not only real but also high, considering the latest statistics released by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in separate publications. According to the new data, published in the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Report and the CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 2.7 million Nigerian children were not vaccinated against measles at nine months of age last year. Sadly, this is contrary to the WHO recommendation, and the reports said such failure increased the risk of serious health challenges like pneumonia, diarrhoea, encephalitis and blindness, among the unimmunised children.
More worrying is the truth that measles could lead to death in extreme cases. Indeed, the WHO report said: The vast majority of deaths from measles occur in developing countries. Furthermore, over 70 per cent of estimated global measles death in 2013 reportedly occurred in six countries, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Democratic Republic of Congo. These countries, in that order, were identified in connection with more than 60 per cent of the estimated 21.5 million unimmunised children last year.
It is tragic that the figures showed a rise in the number of deaths from measles, from an estimated 122,000 in 2012 to 145,700 in 2013, meaning that the target of a 95 per cent reduction in measles-related deaths between 2000 and 2015 is unlikely to be achieved. It is instructive that Dr. Peter Strebel of the WHO Department of Immunisation, Vaccines, and Biologicals, was quoted as saying: Poor progress in increasing measles vaccination coverage has resulted in large outbreaks of this highly contagious disease, throwing the 2015 elimination targets off-track.
Lamentably, the disease is said to have received a boost in 2013 largely as a result of outbreaks in China, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria. It may be recalled that historically low vaccination levels in northern Nigeria reportedly sank lower from early 2000 following the controversy about the motive for polio vaccines, which radical Islamic preachers claimed was a Western move to make Muslims infertile and infect them with HIV. It is not surprising that this situation reportedly led to a significant increase in cases of measles and the related deaths of hundreds of children in the region.
The wisdom in vaccination may be better appreciated against the background of the description of measles as an airborne disease that is spread through respiration (contact with fluids from an infected persons nose and mouth, either directly or through aerosol transmission via coughing or sneezing), and is highly contagious90% of people without immunity sharing living space with an infected person will catch it.
So, it is easy to understand that unvaccinated populations, especially vulnerable babies, are at risk from the disease. In this context, the importance of public enlightenment and awareness cannot be overemphasised; and anti-scientific sentiments, particularly of ethnic and religious colouration, should not be accommodated. It goes without saying that effective advancements in medical science can bring about the elimination of the disease, and that is the point of the WHO target.
Nigeria cannot afford to be seen as a negative factor in the otherwise progressive march towards the elimination of measles. In addition to promptly addressing the education aspect, the country must tackle other problematic issues, particularly its health system; and conflict and population displacement, which are also said to have interfered with vaccination efforts.
Perhaps the last word should come from Dr. Strebel who said: Countries urgently need to prioritise maintaining and improving immunisation coverage. Failure to reverse this alarming trend could jeopardise the momentum generated by a decade of achievements in reducing measles mortality. We couldnt agree more.",10,23,31.391304347826086,0,0.6264564083381132,0.46869986345568165,0.35250644336144127,0.3368725853661696,0.30434782608695654,0.36098351744153806,0.3487616888248861,0.2981243874435313,0.27949994975356934,0.21454972281090676,0.18710893455962424,0.17591658881360975,0.16191352095175401,0.13559817214975384,1.1101816223233214,0.2243481670289825,0.12477198432764319,1.0639979560830164,0.2128942575586129,0.15322193266424836,1.3297903854199657,0.26264909970110806,0.15693083828441945,1.3406948586504581,0.26797886766318635,0.03645833333333333,0.011904761904761904,0,0.021505376344086023,3.083418162363621,3.498084432158588,0,0,1.079093980954446,6.794610083975418,9.292643028746078,-0.6131884334026445,-0.43482975277478664,1.7790188337133126,,-0.03612360245925366,0.39983792582543887,1.090097976600871,0.9943704802972761,0.42316680854639876,-0.570518254722154,-0.47067994612271596,0.5598656952611709,-0.29893930475597147,-0.21206106077143863,-0.46714437472400044,0.745673582459493,-0.27658538288765067,0.9612704232339602,0.9190147807313933,0.9260897330739343,-0.014295967574844692,0.034659736162242015,0.02362473915506465,-0.44820018779121895,-0.10585036611688439,-0.3980323582944264,-0.127280874177835,0.10343161210401401,0.04411926332428691,0.21983241487473956,-0.6712884382738266,-1.1385573984231125,-0.8578041772653608,-0.9594103076308801,-1.069921288851535,,,-1.4085499213981028,0.7429588495689979,-0.058639356065273734,0,5.298382784062179

FMH has seen increase in flu this season, Clark Memorial has not
NEW ALBANY Indiana is one of 36 states where influenza is widespread according to the Centers for Disease Control.
The Associated Press reported last week that five people over the age of 65 have died from the flu in Indiana so far this season, and the season has yet to hit its peak.
Floyd Memorial Hospital and Health Services has also seen an increase in people coming to the emergency room with flu-like symptoms.
We have seen widespread activity. said Dr. Tom Harris, emergency room doctor at FMH. The CDC has called it an epidemic and that goes along with what we have seen.
In November and December, FMH administered 615 influenza screenings with 50 percent of those tests coming back positive, which is compared to only 485 screenings in 2013.
While there have been some reports about the effectiveness of this years vaccine, Harris, who is also the Floyd County health officer, said its important for people to get vaccinated. However, he said many choose not to get the shot and that obviously puts them at a higher risk of being infected.
There has been some question about how accurate the vaccine has been this year, Harris said. Its been about 60 percent accurate. The shot can also lesson the severity of the flu. There are just a lot of people who dont get the shot.
While Floyd County has seen an increase in the flu and screenings, Clark Memorial Hospital has not.
In November 2013, Clark Memorial confirmed 12 cases of the flu compared to only four in 2014 during that same period. There was one more case of the flu in December in the hospitals emergency room then there was in 2013.
But Clark Memorial has administered more influenza screenings this season. In November and December, the ER performed 862 tests compared to 715 over that same period in 2013.
A lot of people have the common cold or something else and think they have the flu, so we have seen an increase in testing, said Bryan Boone, RN, director of emergency services at Clark Memorial. We are putting masks on people who come to the ER who think they have the flu.
Boone said people just need to use common sense get vaccinated, wash their hands regularly, and if they do get sick, stay away from people through the rest of the flu season.
We have posted signs for people to take precaution. Many people here [patients] are at risk and it can further their complications if they are around people who are sick, he said. We are encouraging people not to visit loved ones if they feel sick. It can just make the situation worse.
Several Indiana hospitals have restricted visitors to try to protect patients and staff from the flu virus, the Associated Press reported recently.
Harris said it takes about two weeks after receiving the flu shot for the body to build up antibodies. He said it is definitely not too late to be vaccinated since the season will run at least two to three more months. Harris said while it is important for the elderly and women who are pregnant to be vaccinated, he said everyone should get the shot since they are affordable and may keep you from getting sick.
You have got to be careful with the flu. There are 20,000 deaths in the U.S. associated with it each year, he said. That is half of a football stadium. Most of the people who die do have underlying medical problems.
Harris also said if you do have the flu, you need to be fever-free for two days, without the assistance of medicine, before going back to work or out in the public.
Flu activity most commonly peaks in the U.S. between December and February, according to the CDC website. However, seasonal flu activity can begin as early as October and continue to occur as late as May. The CDC also recommends a yearly flu vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older. While there are many different flu viruses, the seasonal flu vaccine is designed to protect against the main flu viruses that research suggests will cause the most illness during the flu season, the CDC reports.
At Greater Clark County Schools, health officials have kept a close eye on the number of students with reported flu diagnoses, but havent seen much to raise their concerns.
Teresa Stingel, health services coordinator for the district, said theyve had a couple of schools come up to about 15 percent of their students diagnosed with the flu, but that falls below the state health departments guideline of 20 percent for reporting.
We put posters out about hand washing and how to prevent the spread of germs and everything, Stingel said. We just told them to get that information out to the teachers and students if it hadnt already just to lower that risk. Well just continue to look at absentee reports and tell our staff to alert with any increases that come out.

Your child has a cough, runny nose, sore throat and a high fever. The symptoms point to a cold. Then white spots appear in the mouth and red spots on the face, and your family pediatrician says its measles. Distressed, you say, I thought measles were a thing of the past.
Measles were a thing of the past in the United States, just like polio, which destroyed many lives until Jonas Salk in the early 1950s discovered a vaccine. Measles also were fought vigorously back then because the consequences were so deadly.
Before measles vaccines became commonplace in the early 1960s, an estimated 3 million to 4 million Americans a year contracted measles, and 400 to 500 died. Survivors often suffered blindness, deafness and neurological disabilities. Measles were not taken lightly; people wanted a vaccine because too many families suffered too much.
Thats why the resurgence of measles and other preventable illnesses is so distressing. Parents who miss scheduled inoculations or believe the myth that vaccines cause autism are erasing decades of medical progress and putting us all at risk. How misguided, dangerous and selfish is that when history shows us a safe vaccine is available? The measles outbreak at Disneyland last month should sound an alarm that vaccinations arent optional.
The latest measles outbreak has spread toward the 100 mark across several states in just a matter of weeks. Children are in isolation wards, and experts expect more cases as those infected with the highly contagious illness, spread through the air, come into contact with others who have skipped vaccinations. Arizona is monitoring nearly 1,000 people for possible measles exposure, and hospitals in the state are asking those who may have been exposed not to go to doctors offices, emergency rooms or urgent care clinics to minimize further exposures.
The irony is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared measles eradicated in the United States in 2000. In 2001, there were about 100 measles cases nationally; last year there were 644 in 27 states, including Texas. Infections are certain to surpass last years total and cost millions of dollars in health care. Vaccinations could have prevented this hard-to-control spread.
Opposition to vaccines is turning back the clock to a time we should never want to see again, and its not just measles staging a comeback. In 2012, whooping cough cases in the United States were the worst since 1955. There were nearly 50,000 reported cases and 20 deaths, most of them babies younger than 3 months old.

125,yes_28.txt,"New Study Reveals Why Some Parents Hesitate On Vaccinating Their Children
Vaccination has been a hot-button issue for quite a few years now. Many people, from parents, to medical professionals, to celebrities and more have very strong opinions about it. The media often is quick to jump on the opinions of the latter. As a result of that, many parents are hesitant to vaccinate their children, or even flat out refuse. A new study reveals that this happens because of a communication divide between healthcare providers and the parents.
The new study, published in the Journal of Risk Research, and performed at the University of Haifa, School of Public Health suggests that even those parents who are not labeled as vaccine refusers and who typically comply with a normal vaccination schedule may be hesitant or even refuse to vaccinate their children because of poor communication from their childrens healthcare provider, in addition to concerns about the vaccines safety.
The study was performed by Dr. Anat Gesser-Edelsburg, Dr. Yaffa Shir-Raz and Professor Manfred S. Green, and looked closely at parents refusal or apprehension to vaccinate their children, following the polio outbreak in Israel in 2013. While there were zero clinical cases of paralytic polio that were recorded during the outbreak, the Israeli Health Ministry took steps and launched a campaign to make certain that children under the age of 10, who had already been vaccinated with the standard inactivated polio vaccine, be given a bivalent oral polio vaccine, which was created to protect other people who were not previously vaccinated.
While the rate of kids who were vaccinated during the campaign was relatively high, the results of the findings show that for the first time, parents who are not vaccine refusers, and who typically comply with scheduled vaccine programs, actually hesitated or flat-out refused to vaccinate their children. One third of the parents who were surveyed, that were apprehensive about vaccinations shared that the safety of the vaccinations were a concern, and that any information provided by the Health Ministry, or an explanation as to why the vaccine was necessary, was not enough to convince them.
Over a third of all those surveyed communicated that they strongly disagreed that information provided the Health Ministry was comprehensive and clear. Nearly 28 percent of those parents who had their children vaccinated mentioned that they did not really understand that the purpose of the vaccine was not to protect their own child. Those researchers suggested in the long term, that this perceived doubt in their communications with healthcare providers could easily cause a mistrust of the healthcare system entirely. This same theme recurred in the studys analysis of 35 of those who responded to the survey that had refused or were apprehensive about vaccinating their children.
The findings of this study just prove that transparency and credibility are extremely important in health communications. The Health Ministry said that the OPV vaccine had zero side effects. However, findings show that these claims were interpreted as disrespectful to the public and not credible. The researchers suggest that in future instances that risk-communicating organizations should expose the dilemmas, communicate facts, and talk science to everyone, but especially in times of doubt and uncertainty.",7,19,31.210526315789473,0,0.5376811801559396,0.4490172831662958,0.32361457284007755,0.3475012699696457,0.3684210526315789,0.3989430916687799,0.3758518018438779,0.3783680519181496,0.38890321204038913,0.21197738060875546,0.19692345495688698,0.15559668707280672,0.16842776933861897,0.12758964309363194,1.085933941043215,0.2231512248483336,0.1491552539579964,1.2649996675318937,0.2575929643883563,0.15792739619615032,1.3014555813517892,0.2654833798261118,0.16536694733426383,1.3159081822873517,0.27105945591261854,0.004166666666666667,0.021313607027892742,0.015873015873015872,0.03968253968253968,3.0647267538887566,3.5056762220708544,0,0,1.1324580181723038,6.426266808370419,9.565861555034028,-0.9162334739533726,-0.6076407178947341,1.7431286559443657,,-0.7910488415338027,0.24365098421871403,0.8285323235301408,1.0922585796650803,0.6769558219510281,0.4231984059495416,0.40161783425204817,1.31839718886461,1.4479782373399595,-0.295666951555006,0.03136613665566117,0.39941669724183937,-0.11021528351164676,0.769315970951152,0.8478645834966391,0.9087152303737388,1.0026662332418026,1.060706868548384,1.1530685864914672,0.05029857505877127,-0.6743609421936054,-0.15523934596592526,1.028270917525627,-0.4472489903064847,0.37014901534729255,-0.851976442863225,-0.3552382857437825,-0.6540016385938134,0.14006895827677718,-1.2243991070749667,-0.9451854515121887,,,-0.3116327782392434,-0.45237516508772835,0.8981442469913944,0,3.1869037633364194
126,yes_29.txt,"Flu vaccine paradox spreading globally as more vaccinated people catch the flu
(NaturalNews) The conventional medical system is literally grasping at straws trying to maintain the illusion that vaccines work, with new reports now admitting that flu vaccines are an utter failure while still pushing people to get them. The latest nonsensical narrative, at least from the Canadian government, attributes all the inconsistencies between what authorities have long claimed about the alleged efficacy of the flu shot and its actual dismal success rate to a mysterious ""paradox"" where previous vaccinations somehow interfere with current ones.
Since health authorities no longer have a leg to stand on -- it is now widespread knowledge that the flu shot is minimally effective at best -- they are resorting to more confusing pseudoscience that, oddly enough, actually affirms what flu shot skeptics have surmised for many years. Vaccines in general, they now reluctantly admit, affect every person differently. And depending on what previous vaccinations a person has had, flu shots may or may not provide any protection at all--and in some cases, they will make a person more prone to illness.
""People who receive flu vaccines year after year can sometimes show reduced protection, an effect that Canadian infectious disease specialists say muddies public health messages for annual flu vaccine campaigns,"" explains Canada's CBC News about this disturbing phenomenon.
""During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, researchers at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control originally thought seasonal flu shots from 2008 might offer extra protection against the new pandemic strain. They were puzzled to find instead, seasonal flu vaccination almost doubled the risk of infection with pandemic flu.""
Did you read that? An untested vaccine that health authorities all around the world urged everyone to get for their own protection against a novel, pandemic flu strain -- and a vaccine that they promised would also protect against seasonal flu -- actually made people who got it more prone to contracting the flu. This is now being openly admitted, affirming what independent news outlets like Natural News have been warning the public about for years.
And yet, despite this admission, these same health authorities are still trying to scare the public into rushing out and getting a flu shot. Huh? The vaccine doesn't work, they now say. And people who get it year after year are more prone to contracting the flu, they also say. But everyone should still rush out and get it, especially if they're in a high-risk category?
Peer-reviewed study reveals that unvaccinated people are most protected against influenza
At least six separate studies conducted by the same people that are still pushing the flu shot have confirmed that seasonal flu shots make people more prone to contracting the flu. The evidence is now overwhelming that, rather than impart immunity as long claimed, flu shots actually destroy the immune system and increase the risk of infection.
One would think that, now that the cat is out of the bag, these peddlers of quackery would quit while they're ahead, admit that they lied about flu shot safety and efficacy, and go out and find a real profession. Instead, they're continuing to push the seasonal flu shot, which as they now put it causes ""interference"" with people's immune systems, as they hype the soon unveiling of a ""universal"" flu shot that will be better than ever (fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, well, you know the rest).
The real kicker here is that, in the same CBC News report, a study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases is referenced, revealing that the people who are most protected from the flu are, wait for it -- the unvaccinated. So tell me again, why should anyone get a flu shot?",11,24,29.666666666666668,0,0.6425265912776408,0.520505032887635,0.42467274550687184,0.4291108346233765,0.08333333333333333,0.37673588447965856,0.3703778817192069,0.30698834429894173,0.362692508195662,0.23419768220290196,0.20669693948834958,0.19052311844857675,0.20048953211371529,0.12229411184359999,1.0523270701219363,0.20993668803401,0.14952488746237957,1.3007701643786092,0.2581546857038016,0.15058043700448465,1.2996725658549713,0.2593179698736147,0.1500578679185149,1.2984987682420146,0.2587224302112871,0.03666666666666667,0.025011856830038648,0.046511627906976744,0.044105854049719326,3.1534253815564943,3.5704817896809016,0,0,1.1907192027290066,6.67192869126314,9.33085140464136,-0.5121734198857352,-0.3916270114947998,1.4366235090905752,,0.10053373930166204,0.8109268610174548,1.7434383664662971,1.843866654626208,-0.4522542228106418,-0.15814825612606143,0.22535838596728835,0.643655368586691,1.0294538041562946,0.4265340474817743,0.5277923067107436,0.9945729875726179,0.708623413185599,0.6423886921059387,0.7492516288446137,0.7168964363883619,1.0180826768858147,1.2433034019263334,1.167262122024026,-0.7280413361793313,-0.7101354322804504,-0.6833870196560509,-1.0687188254561353,-0.8340304398908193,-0.9355228578243028,0.2267473107311137,-0.2310113058364457,0.28130366526274064,0.3828959877136835,0.03308466626502573,0.11959332049121736,,,0.8859470049410885,0.3448377180413966,0.07516250595598332,0,0.09653379351730136
127,yes_3.txt,"Heartbroken father Richard Mills pleads with Government over lifesaving vaccine for meningitis type B after losing son Harry
Heartbroken parents who lost their 11-year-old son to meningitis are calling on the Government to end the delay over introducing a vaccine to prevent future tragedies.
Richard and Judi Mills from Marlow are spearheading a high profile campaign with a leading charity, after Harrys death in 2007 from meningococcal Group B (MenB) brought their world crashing down.
The popular former Spinfield School pupil and avid sportsmans sudden death has spurred his devastated family on to generate over 120,000 in his memory through a series of sporting events and fundraisers.
Mr and Mrs Mills, of Institute Road, say funding for a long overdue jab - approved for use over a year ago - needs to be found now after plans to roll it out nationwide stalled.
And the determined parents want to stop other families going through the heartache of losing a child, and repay the faith of Marlovians who have given so generously to Harrys cause.
Mr Mills said: ""The issue is conversations between the Government and the people that produce the vaccine.
""There are people getting this disease that shouldnt be getting it. The big concern is there are 200 to 300 people that die each year from it and an awful lot are left with loss of limbs and infection.
""The cost is the last issue and the vaccine is there.
""A lot of people in Marlow have given a lot to raise this money and I feel an obligation to them, to all the parents out there and their future children.
""Anybody that has contracted Meningitis since then, we think it shouldnt have happened. The pain it causes it horrendous and if it can be stopped it should.""
Sports mad Harry, an avid rugby fan who played for Marlow under 12s, was healthy and happy until contracting the disease, which took his life in less than a day.
A vaccine for the type-B strain was approved by the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on March 21 last year, to be routinely given to children in the UK.
And the Mills family are now teaming up with the Meningitis Research Foundation (MRF) to launch the #wheresourvaccine campaign, which aims to put pressure on MPs.
Chris Head, MRF chief executive, said: ""We appreciate that the JCVI stated that the vaccine recommendation was subject to a cost-effective price being agreed between the vaccine manufacturer and the Department of Health, but these price negotiations have been ongoing since July 2014 and have stalled.
""We also realise there are many pressures on NHS budgets but this Government claims to want people to be fit for life throughout their life. Surely the answer is to protect future generations by vaccinating to prevent disease?
""We will not stop until every child is protected from this disease.""
MRF estimates that there are around 3,200 cases of meningitis and septicaemia every year in the UK.
As many as one in ten of those affected will die and a third of survivors will be left with after-effects, some as serious as brain damage, amputations, blindness and hearing loss.
The Department of Health insists it is committed to introducing the vaccine, but says it is yet to strike a deal with manufacturers Novartis.
A spokesperson said:""We are very clear that we want to see this vaccine introduced as soon as possible to help protect children from this devastating disease.
""The JCVI recommended that a MenB vaccine be introduced, but only at a cost-effective price - below the price published by Novartis. We need to make sure NHS funds are used effectively and negotiations are continuing.""",22,26,26.76923076923077,0,0.8148134803771973,0.5835748023253221,0.06474945897405798,0.06474945897405798,0.34615384615384615,0.3525072053433901,0.375318393162624,0.06506981825775872,0.34303426920271024,0.22737638008253402,0.19671811015525223,0.03574593839320269,0.19132388682624737,0.031682176511160925,0.2648951976597914,0.05297069284508437,0.14437507455665,1.233084961280028,0.24579868970369384,0.1621464182735455,1.372832129145002,0.2754212985773194,0.16162690802598817,1.366930144176837,0.2732558741304473,0,0.02727272727272727,0.06097560975609756,0.03291213635027917,3.187068197884175,3.5871215921434585,0,0,1.1367186632811632,6.103953463616745,9.012116219010874,0.598991728800268,-0.30522152893482607,0.8613905105808816,,1.565623985828454,1.311403640559706,-1.515041191916943,-1.5118301108687062,0.5887571675672764,-0.7924135927087921,0.3844421506967891,-1.643164682439324,0.7155571083386698,0.20482908163382282,0.02093602515468078,-1.6428740312350536,0.4745381854260991,-1.5294663758016558,-1.5613170555342435,-1.561581297406906,0.8032974923802343,0.8977928684902231,0.8550516656188594,0.4972635279819509,0.7577408011835959,0.6960728474180622,0.5159720486769561,0.686295672877473,0.6026038677702035,-0.9902743599907043,-0.15506697484668885,0.7228458253113901,-0.23160639481615894,0.5100401359707162,0.3929912565925243,,,-0.22405367245037675,-1.4983345455842,-1.0410158274527408,0,-4.4768576654006536
128,yes_30.txt,"Ebola vaccine: Only government investment in private labs can achieve it
Had a licensed Ebola vaccine or therapeutic been available last year, the outbreak in West Africa would have unfolded very differently.
Health care workers and international volunteers could have been vaccinated and protected before treating sick patients. Those infected could have recovered at a higher rate with an effective treatment. Unfortunately, these products are not yet available.
Drug and vaccine development is costly, risky and time-consuming. In fact, a new study from the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development found that the cost of bringing a new drug to market has doubled in the past 11 years and now costs $2.5 billion. Yet there is no viable commercial market for products for neglected tropical diseases and potential bioterror threats, therefore there is no commercial means to recoup these development costs.
So, if governments want private companies to invest in developing drugs and vaccines for diseases such as Ebola, Marburg, smallpox and pandemic flu, they must take the risk out of that investment by providing development funding, demonstrating a government procurement market and providing clear regulatory pathways.
Fortunately, the U.S. government has put in place a system for the public and private sectors to work together on the development and stockpiling of drugs and vaccines for national security threats such as Ebola and smallpox.
Through partnerships with the National Institutes for Health, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and the BioShield Special Reserve Fund, industry has pushed forward the development of more than 100 medical countermeasures that may otherwise have sat on a shelf. In fact, all of the Ebola drug and vaccine candidates in development have been supported by U.S. government investment.
The problem is that funding for these programs is inadequate and erratic, making it difficult to plan investments in the complex, risky and decadelong drug development process.
Bavarian Nordic, with operations in Denmark, Germany and here in Mountain View, is a biotech company that has successfully partnered with NIH and BARDA over the past decade to develop and supply a new smallpox vaccine for the governments stockpile.
That vaccine is a platform technology that we are adapting to protect against other infectious diseases, including Ebola. In partnership with Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, we have begun human clinical trials of a prime-boost Ebola vaccine regimen.
Furthermore, in our Mountain View facility, we are using a similar platform technology to develop cancer immunotherapies, in partnership with the NIH. That initial federal commitment to invest in a biodefense vaccine more than a decade ago is now yielding candidate products for other diseases of public health significance.
Thanks to champions such as U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Palo Alto, federal investments in medical countermeasure development will produce more breakthroughs in the years to come.
Ebola is fading from the headlines, but the outbreak is far from over, and Congress should recognize the enormous effect a licensed vaccine or therapeutic drug could have. Now is the time to double down on what has worked public-private partnerships through BARDA and the BioShield fund by providing robust and sustained funding for advanced development, manufacturing and procurement of medical countermeasures for the range of biological threats.
As U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice said, Today the danger is Ebola, tomorrow it could be another flu outbreak or a terrorist armed with a biological weapon.

129,yes_31.txt,"Whooping cough evolving fast
Analysis of strains from 2012 shows the parts of the pertussis bacterium that the vaccine primes the immune system to recognise are changing.
It may have serious consequences in future outbreaks, UK researchers state in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.
But experts stressed the vaccine remains highly effective in protecting the most vulnerable young babies.
There has been a global resurgence of whooping cough in recent years.
In 2012, there were almost 10,000 confirmed cases in England and Wales a dramatic increase from the last peak of 900 cases in 2008.
The outbreak led to 14 deaths in babies under three months of age the group who are most vulnerable to infection.
Rising figures prompted health officials to recommend vaccination of pregnant women so immunity could be passed to their newborns a strategy that a recent study showed was working well.
Evolving strains
But there has been much debate among experts about whether the introduction of a new vaccine in 2004 has been a factor in rising rates of whooping cough.
One issue is that immunity from the newer acellular vaccine which contains specific proteins from the surface of the bacteria does not seem to last as long as the previous whole cell version, leaving teenagers and adults lacking protection.
In the latest study, researchers analysed the genes coding for the proteins on the surface of the pertussis bacterium responsible for the UK outbreak.
They found proteins being targeted by the vaccine were mutating at a faster rate than other surface proteins not included in the vaccine.
Potentially it means the bacteria is changing quickly to get around immune systems defences put in place with immunisation.
What is whooping cough?
It is also known as pertussis and is caused by a species of bacteria, Bordetella pertussis
It mostly affects infants, who are at highest risk of complications and even death
The earliest signs are similar to a common cold, then develop into a cough and can even result in pneumonia
Babies may turn blue while coughing due to a lack of oxygen
The cough tends to come in short bursts followed by desperate gasps for air (the whooping noise)
Adults can be infected but the infection often goes unrecognised
But the researchers are still trying to work out what the changes mean in reality for example do the mutations boost the ability of the bacteria to cause infection.
We wanted to look at strains from the UK to see if there was anything sudden that had occurred that had led to these really large outbreaks, said study leader Dr Andrew Preston from the University of Bath.
Vaccine effectiveness
The million dollar question he said was what, if anything, could be done to improve the vaccine which is still the best defence we have and prevent future outbreaks.
Options to consider include adding more or different proteins to the vaccine, adding novel adjuvants chemicals which boost the immune response, or even revisiting the old-style whole cell vaccine, he said.
Pertussis has a cyclical nature and other big question is are we going to see another increase in late 2015, he added
Prof Adam Finn, a paediatric immunology expert at the University of Bristol said the importance or not of the subtle changes found in the study was as yet unclear.
But the control of pertussis is a significant worry, he added.
Only 60% of pregnant women have had the pertussis vaccine and we should be doing more to raise awareness of its benefits, he said.
There is very good new evidence that vaccinating pregnant women protects their babies. And the group we really want to protect is newborn babies, he said.

130,yes_33.txt,"Contagion in the Herd: How One Person Can Set Off a Measles Outbreak
Americans may be victims of their own success when it comes to the eradication of infectious diseases and take their disease-free lives for granted, says Jorge Parada, MD, hospital epidemiologist and medical director of the infection prevention and control program at Loyola University Health System.
There are plenty of countries in the world where measles and chicken pox are very commonplace; I have served in Angola where mothers begged me for vaccines for their children because they had to live through seeing their other children and neighbors children suffering from natural infection, says Parada.
In America, typically we no longer see many of these potentially deadly infectious diseases because so many people have been vaccinated. The diseases have basically died out in this country. Unfortunately, that has led to increasing numbers of people to opt out of vaccinations leaving them vulnerable to infection. The problem is that people appear to have not only forgotten the negative impact of these infections, but also that these infections are still prevalent elsewhere so it is only a matter of time before they get reintroduced to the United States. The current measles outbreak is a textbook example of this, Parada says.
At least 85 cases of measles in seven states are traced back to Disneyland exposures during the week before Christmas. The expectation is that the outbreak will continue to spread further. The key to successful eradication of many infectious disease, such as measles, is through vaccination.
When enough people in a population are vaccinated, it creates a situation we call herd immunity. The large number of vaccinated people act as a firewall, which provides a degree of protection to unvaccinated persons, explains Parada, who also serves as professor of medicine at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine. What we are seeing now with the measles is a break in the herd immunity. One person who has the measles is now able to spread the disease widely through a chain of contagion through exposure to people who are not vaccinated.
If you think the cold or the flu, is contagious, you havent see anything until you see measles, says Parada. Just walking into the same room as a person with measles can transmit the disease, cautions Parada. And the measles is amplified through the ease of spreading through exposure to large populations where the odds are there may be unvaccinated individuals.
A person with measles can start spreading it four to five days before a rash appears, and it can spread for about four days after the rash is gone. Therefore, many people with measles spread the infection unknowingly, says Parada. Citing Centers for Disease Control data, Parada says, As many as one in five of the people who get measles will develop serious complications. One in a thousand develops inflammation of the brain. Roughly, one in a thousand dies.
To put that another way, Parada cautions, if you are unvaccinated, youre about 35,000 times more likely to die from measles than you are to win the Lotters PowerBall.
As a rule, Parada urges people to be vaccinated - - if not for themselves, for other people. A young adult may have a healthy immune system and get a very mild version of an infectious disease but the oldest and youngest, or someone with a chronic disease who is immunocompromised, or pregnant are at much greater risk for severe infection and complications, he says. If you wont get vaccinated for yourself, do it for your grandparents or for your baby niece or just for the greater good of society.
 Parada says it is up to leaders in a community to step up and promote vaccination. Studies have shown that when a physician recommends vaccinations, people get them, says Parada, who has practiced medicine for more than two decades. Doctors need to build review of vaccines in their practice so that if a patient comes in with a sprained ankle or a headache, the office can check the vaccination record and recommend the patient get it right there at that time.
Fending off the measles for a lifetime requires only two shots. The measles virus is very stable and does not mutate. Therefore, once an individual completes the two-shot vaccine series, he or she will have a lifetime of protection, he says, comparing it with the flu virus, which mutates rapidly so that a new vaccine is recommended each year. It is truly unfortunate that we are seeing so much damage when all it takes to prevent this measles outbreak is a simple vaccination.

131,yes_34.txt,"Whalen: Vaccination is safe, necessary for public health
One of the challenges I face as a scientist is how to best convey the findings of my research, or the research of others, to an audience outside of my field. Yet, complex discoveries often inform public health and health policy. Scientists often engage with the community to explain research findings to a broad and critical audience of policymakers, journalists and laypeople. However, there is often a wide communication gap between the sphere of scientists and that of the public. Nowhere is this gap more evident than the ongoing discussion surrounding vaccination in the United States. The alarming rise in measles cases, including the outbreak of more than 140 cases associated with Disneyland, has brought this public health problem into clear focus.
Measles was eliminated from the United States in 2000, but elimination does not mean it is gone forever. In recent years, the number of measles cases has trended upward, as vaccination levels have fallen in some parts of the country. This is troubling for several reasons.
From a public health perspective, high vaccination levels are necessary because they create population immunity, sometimes called herd immunity. Diseases like measles are highly contagious, with one sick individual often infecting up to 12 additional people. To achieve population immunity against measles, we need to vaccinate more than 90 percent of the population. If this population immunity wanes because people decide not to vaccinate themselves or their children, then the outcome is predictable: measles will re-emerge and spread.
Measles is not a benign disease. Because measles outbreaks have been few and far between during the past 25 years, many have forgotten how dangerous the disease truly is. Measles may be accompanied by serious consequences such as pneumonia, brain damage and death. In rare cases, it may cause a life-threatening neurologic condition that develops later in life.
There also are economic ramifications from measles outbreaks. From the high cost of providing care to someone infected with measles to the lost wages and productivity stemming from workplace absences, the economic consequences can be far-reaching and affect individuals and communities alike.
What might be most troubling, however, is the misinformation about vaccine safety. With some prominent celebrities leading the way, pseudo-science and poorly sourced information have had a disproportional impact on the national dialogue. This misinformation has led some to decide to forego vaccinations for their children.
For instance, there is a myth that the measles vaccine causes autism. The cause, or causes, of autism are not known, but multiple studies have proven the measles vaccine is not associated with autism, and therefore cannot cause it.
This leads us back to the communication challenge that sparked the need for this column. The lack of vaccination in some sectors of the population shows what happens when accurate and clear messages about vaccines are either misunderstood or go unheeded. Instead of processing the message, the public is left to navigate through a confusing cloud of misinformation.
This is, in part, the fault of the scientific community. Scientists are often unwilling, or unable, to share their research findings with the public in a way that is accessible without diminishing the science. But there is another reason - they may fear what they share will be misunderstood.
With that in mind, let me make my attempt to be clear, concise and accurate. Childhood vaccinations are safe. They protect the individual child from infection and can help protect children who cannot be vaccinated because of medical reasons. They do not produce long-term, severe side effects.
Vaccines are a central strategy in the control of infectious diseases in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that vaccines were the single most important public health achievement in the 20th century. But this remarkable achievement may be reversed in the 21st century unless we maintain high levels of appropriate vaccination.
More than anything, dialogue is important - between scientists, doctors, families and advocates. If you have questions or concerns about measles and its vaccine, seek advice from knowledgeable practitioners whom you trust. Your family doctor or local public health district office will likely have the answers you seek about the safety and usefulness of vaccines.

132,yes_35.txt,"Vaccinate against measles
MEASLES IS making a comeback. The extremely contagious potentially life-threatening disease was declared all-but-eradicated in 2000, after decades of immunization programs for preschool children. But reported cases of the disease in the United States, which have averaged between 50 and 100 a year for the past two decades, last year spiked to 644. The latest outbreak has been identified as beginning in Disneyland, of all places, last December. Since the beginning of this year through Jan. 30, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 102 cases in 14 states. Central to the problem is a lack of immunization. The cause is clear: parents who have refused to have their children vaccinated.
Immunization is required nationwide in school systems, although there are exemptions for medical reasons, as advised by a pediatrician, or on the basis of religious belief. A medical exemption can be obtained with a note from a doctor; a religious exemption requires a note from a parent although many religions endorse vaccination.
But some parents are choosing based on unfounded fears about the safety of vaccines. The most popular objections to vaccines cite a causal link between vaccines and autism, but those claims linked to a 1998 British study that was shown to be fraudulent have now been refuted by numerous other studies and have been shown to be completely without merit.
The best defense against measles outbreaks in the greater population is comprehensive immunization that creates herd immunity. That is, when the vast majority of the population has been immunized, then everyone is protected. Ideally, a minimum of 90 percent immunization protects everyone. The danger comes in pockets, or clusters, of unimmunized people, which allow the disease to spread the most vulnerable being infants under 12 months, who are too young to be vaccinated.
The measles virus is an airborne contagion: After a person with measles sneezes, the virus can live in the air for up to two hours. Before measles vaccines became common, in 1963, tens of thousands of people contracted the disease every year, many were hospitalized, and up to 500 per year died. Its effects included encephalitis, pneumonia, blindness, and deafness. Measles is far more contagious than Ebola, but it says something about our society that more people seem to have been afraid of Ebola than of measles, and more people are afraid of the demonstrably effective vaccine than of the disease itself.
Massachusetts is fortunate. The states Department of Public Health estimates a minimum annual immunization rate of 96 percent. But there are still pockets of unimmunized people, mostly in Western Massachusetts and on the Cape and Islands. In some instances, the immunization rate falls as low as 69 percent. Meanwhile, the number of religious exemptions claimed by parents has climbed from 347 in 2002-2003 to 837 in 2013-14, according to the DPH.
A parents concerns for his or her children are understandable, but the fears about vaccines are simply irrational. The benefits so far outweigh the risks that it becomes difficult to defend an anti-vaccine position in any scientific way, says Dr. Lawrence Madoff, director of the DPHs division of epidemiology and immunization. Parents would do well to focus on the very real, extensively documented dangers of a highly infectious disease. Theres more danger created by an unvaccinated child than by a scientifically proven vaccine.",8,29,21.96551724137931,0,0.5545349184955869,0.3927302350235066,0.4079729981410007,0.4102087726683489,0.06896551724137931,0.4069947798143734,0.365104627259629,0.3919070249308407,0.3333332872355327,0.21222382316535168,0.17367555163498338,0.18744099487516064,0.1920135243434303,0.1518181613852864,1.2424097842932726,0.25199156581028465,0.13301765845420666,1.1170174689159824,0.22569290515509718,0.1515573372467222,1.2776772541779484,0.2552354438338856,0.14769639402541715,1.2717596173074988,0.25389939973763476,0.037037037037037035,0.029274891774891773,0.018518518518518517,0.012121212121212121,3.099798252190975,3.5154428287892054,0,0,1.0920556185437138,6.842863243982858,9.564918148413957,-0.8152184604364633,-0.17561330509486553,-0.09229910824828091,,-0.647728315009794,-0.20300294896674193,1.5922511900375376,1.6697823734626664,-0.5091640128649435,0.6339778158794617,0.05556034351481337,1.4463790985694145,0.5606548209682098,-0.2876571115523906,-1.1494683518782203,0.9420527282721519,0.4921511248556872,1.350043333704912,1.3070131091270125,1.3273541504645356,0.3296094657033993,0.3053067804617192,0.3470200856275294,-0.6245481183737642,-1.1514501942390636,-1.0331085543593548,-1.3921861220625464,-1.428088777073992,-1.4459615474525271,0.2390404589202229,-0.08781277010442091,-0.5732423452889303,-1.3729673632456298,-0.727189159397254,-0.7847165922502602,,,-1.142118758833771,0.8995482250010055,0.8948405325714316,0,6.773500636843052
133,yes_36.txt,"Paul Offit and Rotavirus Vaccine: Deaths on VAERS
In the developed world rotavirus infection does not seem to be associated with mortality: this is not quite so with rotavirus vaccines, including Merck's RotaTeq vaccine in which Professor Offit had a share.
A table of cases of rotavirus reported by the UK National Health Service between 2000 and 2012 listed a remarkably consistent figure of around 15,000 annually (approximately 200,000 cases): no deaths are mentioned. It was evident that when a vaccine, GSKs Rotarix, was introduced to the British schedule last year it was to prevent diarrhoea not death.
The original rotavirus vaccine RotaShield, marketed by Lederle, was withdrawn after a year because Intussusseptionof an association with a serious gastric condition intussusception in which the bowel folds in on itself causing a blockage. Intussusception can kill. Reports on VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) for Lederles RotaShield lists 124 reported cases of intussusception in one of which the patient died (1 in 124). The newer products, Mercks RotaTeq, which Paul Offit helped to develop and profitted from, and GSKs Rotarix are both associated with an elevated level of intussusception. Reports on VAERS (9 February 2015) for the Offit/Merck Rotateq vaccine introduced in 2006 list 1,068 cases of intussusception with 10 accompanying deaths (1 in 107) while Rotarix (introduced in 2008?) has 553 cases of intussusception and 11 deaths (a very disturbing rate of 1 in 50). It is not known how many doses of the respective vaccines this represents.
Intussusception is a symptom specifically associated with rotavirus vaccines. It should be borne in mind that these vaccines have seldom been administered separately from other vaccines, however reports of total outcomes on VAERS in which the patient died are alarmingly high:
Rotashield 10
Rotateq 303
Rotarix 106
Unspecified 16
One of the evident problems is that exposure to multiple toxicities in one go might not just increase the overall risk of death it also makes it difficult to disentangle which vaccines are doing what. However, as a point of comparison there have been 425 deaths associated on VAERS with rotavirus vaccines since 2006 compared with a mere 329 for MMR since 1989.
While listing on VAERS does not mean a vaccine injury report is confirmed it is also as a passive reporting database likely to under-report by many times and may represent numerically no more than 1 or 2% of cases.
On March 22, 2010 the FDA suspended the use of GSKs Rotarix vaccine after it was found to be contaminated with porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV-1). Then on May 6 the Offit/Merck version Rotateq was found to be contaminated not only by PCV-1 but another related virus, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2). On May 7, according to information on the FDA website a meeting was swiftly convened:
to discuss the findings of PCV and PCV DNA in rotavirus vaccines. Based on a careful evaluation of this information, a thorough review of the scientific literature, and input from scientific and public health experts, the Agency is revising its recommendation to temporarily suspend use of the Rotarix vaccine. FDA has determined it is appropriate for clinicians and health care professionals to resume the use of Rotarix and to continue the use of RotaTeq.
Evidently the system had to patch itself up rapidly when a product patented by its most prominent advocate was determined to be faulty. Buried now in the product insert for Rotateq is the elliptical statement:
In the manufacturing process for RotaTeq, a porcine-derived material is used. DNA from porcine circoviruses (PCV) 1 and 2 has been detected in RotaTeq. PCV-1 and PCV-2 are not known to cause disease in humans.
But presumably not known not to cause disease in humans either. And it seems likely few pediatricians or nurses draw the attention of parents to this matter in obtaining consent.
According to an article by Dan Olmsted and Mark Blaxill written in 2009 Offit made at least $29m from his stake in Rotateq vaccine and took part in votes as a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices to his own ultimate financial benefit.
From FDA: Update on Recommendations for the Use of Rotavirus Vaccines, May 14, 2010
Background
On March 22, 2010, FDA provided an early communication regarding Rotarix, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (GSK) At that time, FDA recommended that clinicians and public health professionals in the United States temporarily suspend the use of Rotarix while the agency and manufacturer investigated the finding of DNA from porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) in the vaccine. Since that time, both FDA and GSK have confirmed the presence of PCV1 in the vaccine.
On May 6, 2010, FDA provided information about RotaTeq, manufactured by Merck & Co, Inc. FDA indicated that preliminary studies conducted by Merck identified fragments of DNA from PCV1 and from a related porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in RotaTeq. FDA noted that it would seek input from its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) and provide updates in the near future.
Updated Recommendations
FDA has evaluated laboratory results from the manufacturers and its own laboratories. In addition, FDAs VRBPAC convened on May 7, 2010 to discuss the findings of PCV and PCV DNA in rotavirus vaccines. Based on a careful evaluation of this information, a thorough review of the scientific literature, and input from scientific and public health experts, the Agency is revising its recommendation to temporarily suspend use of the Rotarix vaccine. FDA has determined it is appropriate for clinicians and health care professionals to resume the use of Rotarix and to continue the use of RotaTeq.
FDA considered the following information in its decision:
*Both vaccines have strong safety records, including clinical trials involving tens of thousands of patients as well as clinical experience with millions of recipients. FDA has no evidence that either PCV1 or PCV2 poses a safety risk in humans, and notes that neither is known to cause infection or illness in humans.
 *The benefits of the vaccines are substantial, and include prevention of hospitalization for severe rotavirus disease in the U.S. and of death in other parts of the world. The benefits of the vaccines, which are known, outweigh the risk, which is theoretical.",26,50,23.24,0,0.6773638290410139,0.4366477244636234,0.2554655992067777,0.24726766252364868,0.14,0.3888594737838743,0.3716866064159165,0.27072138755242264,0.251357167811498,0.23374481622199966,0.20076142086001553,0.14804581118318888,0.14748996741212045,0.09855584441732618,0.8432572080028645,0.16957201901008032,0.10171691473617218,0.8713665876542005,0.17368284728816233,0.15151640444783274,1.3093346491392128,0.26089580492225095,0.15367971212515638,1.3149665012270837,0.26264470574516935,0.011428571428571429,0.014576599870717516,0.009523809523809525,0.01922731356693621,3.085236463847342,3.488523298308792,0,0,1.1471204409087845,6.3830647776044245,9.585659773282298,1.0030517828679053,0.7316442617848584,0.16072617505102088,,0.396782034977599,0.14549497446845305,0.2115618583844776,0.1691267254694689,-0.22780201083647594,0.159226554418955,0.2674991347807432,0.30082918972879547,-0.7483145649661775,0.41181506347286373,0.22630855539676664,0.2707476318322334,-0.6449545167055281,0.07341203109601235,0.13577598332715862,0.1309733548168185,-0.975862429627034,-0.9486595687297207,-0.9671664764394391,-0.6288845561057859,-0.5162750293354118,-0.5482248947001166,-0.5726099513855007,-0.46817012898398874,-0.5204143083733228,-0.6109429301553325,-0.5815394004668525,-0.847823942525533,-0.9828631649671075,-0.9336321792545992,-1.227014155020143,,,-0.010241360003262083,-0.5925728021750885,0.9674756018121828,0,2.5384506185759292
134,yes_38.txt,"Pro-Life Groups say Merck is Partly to Blame for Measles Outbreaks
As the measles outbreak focuses attention on parents who object to vaccination, some pro-life groups argue one culprit contributing to the problem is actually Merck, which makes the only measles vaccine available in the U.S. And some have begun a new campaign this week to pressure the drug maker to alter the composition of its vaccine.
At issue is the MMR or measles, mumps and rubella combination vaccine sold by Merck. Pro-life groups say they object to the rubella component on religious grounds because it was made using cell lines derived from aborted fetuses. As a result, the groups say pro-life supporters have avoided the MMR vaccine ever since Merck ended production in 2009 of a dedicated measles vaccine.
The current outbreak would not be as severe or widespread if parents had the ability to access separate vaccines, says Debi Vinnedge, the director of Children of God for Life, a non-profit, pro-life organization. Parents are being unfairly targeted as the problem when Merck is the problem. If they had the separate doses available more people would have been vaccinated.
To what extent a separate measles vaccine might mitigate any recent outbreak or uptick in the disease is unclear. Children of God for Life and the American Life League, another pro-life group that this week has called for Merck to change its vaccine production, are uncertain of the number of supporters who would vaccinate their children if MMR was not offered only as a combined product.
Will Merck consider shifting its vaccine production strategy? We asked the drug maker for comment and will update you accordingly. [UPDATE: A Merck spokeswoman sends us this: ""There is no medical reason to administer the measles, mumps and rubella antigens separately and the (CDC) guidelines do not support their use. Major religious groups have accepted use of the rubella vaccine because of the public health value it provides and because there is currently no alternative to prevent this potentially serious disease."" And she notes that some religious organizations, such as the National Catholic Bioethics Center, support use of the vaccine.]
Both organizations, meanwhile, maintain that they do not oppose vaccines. We dont have a problem with vaccination, in and of itself. Thats not our mission, says a spokesman for American Life League, which mails materials to up to 60,000 U.S. households. The issue is that some people have an ethical concern receiving the rubella vaccine because of where it comes from.
As The Wall Street Journal recently noted, large measles outbreaks in the U.S. have become more common in the past two years, even though measles has not been indigenous since 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At the same time, some parents remain concerned about a possible link between vaccines and autism, as well as overwhelming immune systems, prompting more to opt-out of vaccination.
Between 2001 and 2011, there were 63 outbreaks of measles in the U.S., but they were small, according to the CDC. But outbreaks can erupt when someone who has been infected in another country brings the disease to the U.S. and passes it to people in communities where many are unvaccinated. The spread is mitigated when people are protected by herd immunity, which means 92% to 94% of a population is vaccinated or immune.",9,24,26.583333333333332,0,0.5901954102775325,0.43305853101006453,0.3487201843548704,0.3589273603426086,0.2916666666666667,0.36501054998773796,0.35205477372060573,0.33074441904847335,0.37198374235806353,0.16568502651957365,0.16660152103248246,0.1590281691117626,0.1877595777618577,0.12801668573391453,1.1135600223260536,0.22065572061978178,0.14923460911699626,1.2945077588992524,0.2556787166268206,0.15327478053547253,1.3250326176758258,0.26273482822532834,0.15578566991751489,1.3296811822642094,0.26487664582188053,0.003472222222222222,0.00415263748597082,0,0.01240079365079365,3.1061202035135667,3.51186824617743,0,0,1.0907004253056884,6.492769485944298,9.740558593412144,-0.7142034469195538,-0.3916270114947998,0.8244839686411,,-0.3444792461506601,0.11701369101353229,1.0558199844917642,1.1974906296826624,0.3729377329767325,-0.4650974375583475,-0.36464308156227465,0.8682180300740281,1.1778133649842684,-1.8002542871192801,-1.5087807248141039,0.4578901238186664,0.3835078135346941,0.7795516503802211,0.9289280513553146,0.872491137298652,1.005975928716039,1.2113358970846269,1.1046995058203162,-0.4426014623424094,-0.2013103973403967,-0.3906885934864604,-0.2841424498592338,-0.1412570205422403,-0.28420004966007906,-0.8750260957178049,-0.9316881018805256,-1.1385573984231125,-1.3576191544867313,-0.6375626182315465,-0.843448269545232,,,-1.1699752474463962,-0.23656312823367953,1.5099155792420633,0,4.570742258378832
135,yes_39.txt,"Epidemic of irresponsibility widens measles threat
Somebody went to Disneyland in December with a case of the measles, and at least 94 people got sick. Several cases have appeared in eight other states and Mexico, too. Hundreds more people have been quarantined. Public health officials worry that the epidemic could get worse as tens of thousands of sports fans converge on Phoenix for Super Bowl XLIX.
And all of it could have been prevented, if not for the blinkered attitudes of a few.
The California Department of Health this week confirmed 79 cases of measles in the state, of which 52 have been linked directly to last months outbreak at the Happiest Place on Earth. Health officials know for certain that at least 34 patients were unvaccinated, three were partly vaccinated, and five were fully vaccinated.
Now, six of those unvaccinated cases were infants, meaning they were too young to receive the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine that most American children get as a matter of course. Ordinarily kids receive the vaccine after their first birthday, and again between the ages of 4 and 6.
So those babies and their parents are blameless. Pray for them.
But the parents of older unvaccinated children are much less deserving of our sympathy. At least 23 cases are located in Orange County the largest concentration in the state by far, which makes sense given Disneylands location.
Orange County also happens to be a haven for the anti-vaccination movement. California law allows parents to opt their kids out of vaccines with a personal belief exemption signed by a pediatrician. Countywide, about 3 percent of kindergartners have exemptions, compared with just 2 percent in L.A. County. But in certain school districts Capistrano Unified, for example exemptions run between 8 and 9 percent.
So a lack of vaccination made this outbreak possible. Were facing an epidemic of measles because we have an epidemic of irresponsibility.
Measles is ridiculously contagious. Unlike the Ebola virus, which threw the nation into a tizzy this past autumn, measles is likely to sicken 90 percent of the people who come into close proximity with an infected patient.
To put the matter in proper perspective: the United States had 635 confirmed cases of measles last year, versus 10 cases of Ebola only two of which were contracted inside the country, both by nurses who treated Ebola patients from West Africa.
Your odds of getting Ebola? Almost infinitesimal. Your odds of getting measles? High if you havent been vaccinated, greatly diminished if you have.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97 percent effective against measles infection. Obviously, 97 percent means there will be a few who get sick even though theyve been vaccinated as weve seen with this outbreak. So it goes.
And because nothing is 100 percent guaranteed effective, that also means some people will have adverse reactions to the vaccine itself. In a nation of 322 million, that would mean a few million people mostly kids will suffer.
Its a risk, but one thats worthwhile. On balance, its better to be vaccinated than unvaccinated. The more people who are vaccinated, the less likely disease will spread.
Yet millions of Americans believe that vaccinations are harmful. In the face of all evidence, one-third of Americans believe a link exists between vaccinations and autism. They reject the possibility that autism has a genetic component, or that medical science has become more adept at identifying children on the spectrum.
Many parents often well-educated people in wealthy communities are convinced that vaccinations are just a way for greedy pharmaceutical companies and complacent doctors to bolster their bottom lines. Never mind that vaccines tend to lose money. They refuse to sacrifice their children to Big Pharma, even if that means their children contract a potentially fatal and wholly preventable disease.
Heres where personal belief collides with the public good. We are individuals with God-given rights. But we live among other people with rights as well. Your right to refuse to vaccinate your children ends where my childrens right to avoid needless exposure to infection begins.
Even from a libertarian point of view, vaccination is a matter of rational self-interest. If living a healthy, autonomous life is one end of freedom, then vaccination is a means to that end.
But the anti-vaccination movement has taken an awful toll. How many more epidemics will it take before this wretched belief recedes to the fringes, where it belongs?

For some vaccination proponents, the recent measles outbreak is proof positive the government should bust into the yurts of every Joe Moonbeam and Mary Windsong to immunize their children.

137,yes_40.txt,"100 million reasons why vaccine deniers are wrong
The breakout of measles in Disneyland in late 2014 ignited a long-simmering debate over vaccines in the United States. This time, people from political leaders to medical professionals to countless media outlets are weighing in about vaccines. A month has passed since the outbreak and the debate continues over whether vaccines are safe and whether parents should be mandated to vaccinate their children.
Proponents of vaccines tend to focus on the things vaccines can do. What about the things vaccines have already accomplished? They helped rid the world of smallpox and put polio on the brink of eradication. People are putting their lives at stake to vaccinate children against polio in Pakistan. Soon, polio will join the dinosaurs and the dodo bird as an extinct part of the worlds past. Then there is this: vaccines have prevented more than 100 million serious cases of contagious diseases in the United States since 1924.
It is worth repeating, vaccines have prevented more than 100 million serious cases of contagious diseases in the United States since 1924.
Scientists from the University of Pittsburgh looked at the number of reported cases of polio, measles, rubella, mumps, hepatitis A, diphtheria and whooping cough before and after vaccines were available. The projections are based on how many cases would have occurred if a vaccine were not developed for each. The research was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in late 2013. It showed just how important vaccines have been in a historical context and why they still matter today.
All the infections avoided over nearly a century could be for naught if Americans spend more time getting health advice from former Playboy model Jenny McCarthy as opposed to scientific researchers.
We also are able to see a resurgence of some of these diseases in the past several decades as people forget how devastating they can be and start refusing vaccines, said lead author Dr. Willem G. van Panhuis, Ph.D., assistant professor of epidemiology at Pitt Public Health, in a statement.
McCarthy and other vaccine deniers argue that that they cause more harm than good. The swell over the past decade can be traced to the discredited study published in the medical journal The Lancet by Dr. Andrew Wakefield in 1998 that linked the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine with autism. Despite the British journal retracting the study over grave ethical lapses by Wakefield, the damage by the study was done.
Parents in the West, from the United Kingdom to the United States, withheld vaccines from their children. As a result measles recently made a comeback in the United Kingdom and there have been more reported cases of whooping cough, pertussis. The whooping cough vaccine has been available for decades, but last year saw the largest outbreak of the disease since 1959.
A study published in fall 2013 in Pediatrics found that a lack of vaccines was one of the factors that contributed to the 9120 reported cases in California in 2010, the most since 1947. People living in areas of California that had a high rate of personal belief vaccine exemptions were 2.5 times more likely to catch whooping cough.
Our ndings suggest that communities with large numbers of intentionally unvaccinated or undervaccinated persons can lead to pertussis outbreaks. In the presence of limited vaccine effectiveness and waning immunity, concluded the authors.
Vaccines can prevent against some diseases, but there is no vaccine for bad decisions. Those decisions are aiding the return of infections that were not problems for years.
The data dive is an impressive accomplishment and one that the researchers hope will help others out. It was put together thanks to financial backing from the U.S. National Institutes for Health, NIH, and the Gates Foundation.
Aside from the stunning findings, the hope is that the new database will help inform further research. All of it is available on a public database.
Analyzing historical epidemiological data can reveal patterns that help us understand how infectious diseases spread and what interventions have been most effective, said Irene Eckstrand, Ph.D., of NIH
The team digitized the data set and named it Tycho Brahe, the Danish nobleman who paved the way for Johannes Keplers discover of the laws of planetary motion. Project TychoTM hopes to be the information that can inform the next Kepler of infectious diseases.
By rescuing these historical disease data and combining them into a single, open-access, computable system, we now can better understand the devastating impact of epidemic diseases, and the remarkable value of vaccines in preventing illness and death, explained senior author Dr. Donald S. Burke, Pitt Public Health dean and UPMC-Jonas Salk Chair of Global Health.",17,37,23.324324324324323,0,0.6406221894754304,0.39482415029046675,0.3267469713500902,0.31997732686645847,0.05405405405405406,0.39132922885502563,0.36778643888804713,0.3016443874221295,0.34842700144149064,0.24310148148624985,0.19617197392197105,0.1665031328686895,0.2493518934614285,0.11801709637396365,1.0006240632223506,0.2007314166170059,0.15380107522501602,1.3043836329713734,0.261134822047531,0.1617621073654579,1.3732602654772927,0.2745258603847564,0.1639142794914181,1.381689276608417,0.2793048701526008,0.00641025641025641,0.007329598506069094,0.012345679012345678,0.018970189701897018,3.1326763360550975,3.525864240745372,0,0,1.108040262206929,6.692981977132541,9.64425387349238,0.09391666121572108,0.1700086251450293,0.17746723012364932,,0.08433912042805619,-0.18638712844312424,0.8568907457147963,0.8387684651313002,-0.5682271463267052,0.22388051358323321,0.14191429594064306,0.5931397345106462,0.8016665931093692,0.7159240321501533,-0.006803960286879061,0.5852656249703799,1.9565395856110614,0.5398739661024717,0.5975390136860882,0.5832751005573662,1.196431248841994,1.2617489617220574,1.2425640020195574,0.4565494706032105,0.7663309446807696,0.6193669021558346,0.8292890268658151,1.0141963490075048,1.2427909078442432,-0.7775083336407362,-0.8249716024755538,-0.7616806963336576,-0.99697851358625,-0.2610753305281365,-0.6134890475430019,,,-0.8135486098046644,0.4131590649660871,1.172666205387068,0,2.783904744236956
138,yes_41.txt,"Human tests of Ebola vaccines 'about to begin' in affected countries
(AFP Human tests of two possible Ebola vaccines have proven safe and efficacy tests will begin within weeks in the three west African countries ravaged by the deadly virus, the World Health Organization said Friday.
""These trials are about to begin for the two lead vaccines,"" WHO assistant director general Marie-Paule Kieny told reporters, adding that the vaccines would be tested on thousands of people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
The Phase III testing to ensure the vaccines actually protect against the virus that has killed 8,259 people in the three countries is set to begin in Liberia by the end of the month, she said.
Separate tests are scheduled to start in Sierra Leone and Guinea in February, she added.
The vaccine manufacturers must determine before then what the appropriate dosage is, she said.
There is no licensed treatment or vaccine for Ebola, and the WHO has endorsed rushing potential ones through trials in a bid to stem the epidemic. 
The two potential vaccines that have been undergoing Phase 1 safety tests on humans are ChAd3, made by Britain's GlaxoSmithKline, and VSV-ZEBOV, manufactured by the Public Health Agency of Canada and licenced by US firm NewLink Genetics.
Tests of the two potential vaccines have been conducted on volunteers in a range of countries, including Switzerland, Mali, Gabon, Britain, Germany, Canada and the United States.
Johnson & Johnson meanwhile announced this week that human trials of its proposed vaccine had begun in Britain, and Kieny said the company also expected to soon be able to start efficacy trials.
Describing 2014 as the year when ""the Ebola virus challenged humanity,"" Kieny voiced confidence that this year would be remembered as the one when ""humanity used our best scientific minds to fight back.""",11,11,31.454545454545453,0,0.9766034364700318,0.9225687449628657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34809311896207784,0.38225121489506325,0.0,0.32554030501932807,0.2065245591636215,0.2070378458306837,0.0,0.1850210605245648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15929071102583586,1.3513973756602196,0.27288557990323026,0.15663410180360146,1.334874074043746,0.27066414326184063,0.15900659404203038,1.3356484215409965,0.268920290673265,0,0.006060606060606061,0,0.03875968992248062,3.1557070993054066,3.5528060050879327,0,0,1.084335306449624,6.006095150467277,8.969716387582556,-0.5121734198857352,-0.9532626481346289,1.791574200849975,,2.941450596294659,4.001418178557839,-2.1012349625834235,-2.1081599212378324,-0.7823310051255915,-0.907966816580469,0.6076780229392209,-2.258260051708935,0.4362188850174264,-0.47289375824615903,0.5451080173283448,-2.2519949534272374,0.31356768263179724,-2.2888486289856265,-2.338601503573252,-2.3304901559527744,1.425389554693396,1.5017385395267193,1.5394813426534044,-0.08671357057055468,-0.0038510460882025745,0.2885605274570625,0.157049647235984,-0.008684065962504572,0.14375345188592578,-0.9902743599907043,-0.867598008872879,-1.1385573984231125,0.08940720393382559,0.06543266442512206,-0.17082617442545514,,,-1.3008125745203754,-1.8159007347113423,-1.1894957421720906,0,-6.686025509590599
139,yes_43.txt,"To the parents who want an alternative vaccine schedule: Heres what I say
It happens every once in a while in my practice: Parents ask if we can delay or skip certain vaccines, or spread them out.
According to a study just published in the journal Pediatrics, Im not alone in fact, 93 percent of pediatricians get asked the same thing.
Now, its important to point out that most families dont ask for this. Most families are fine with the current vaccine schedule as they should be, since it has been carefully studied and is felt to be safe. We give so many vaccines to babies because they are the ones who are most likely to get very sick from vaccine-preventable diseases. Not only do we think they can handle it, we think its the best thing for their health and safety.
But some families worry. They have heard things. They dont like all the shots at once. There are certain shots that particularly frighten them or that they dont want at all. Its uncommon for parents to refuse all vaccines, but refusing some or wanting to do them differently is more common a recent survey showed that 13 percent of parents of young children used some kind of alternative schedule.
Now, most of us pediatricians dont like this alternative schedule idea. The reasons doctors gave in the study are the same ones I have. Mostly, we think it puts children at risk of disease. I have seen babies die of meningitis caused by haemophilus influenza or pneumococcus, or get very sick from whooping cough or rotavirus (there have been deaths from whooping cough in newborns). I am worried about the resurgence of polio. I am very worried about the resurgence of measles.
Like almost half of the doctors in the study, I also worry that it sends a mixed message if I agree to spacing out the vaccines. The schedule is fine, but its fine to tweak it? Does that say to parents that tweaking it might be better? I certainly dont want to send that message.
But heres the thing: For me, some vaccines are better than none. If it takes tweaking the schedule for a child to get vaccinated, Ill tweak. And Im not alone there, either; in the study, most doctors were willing to do an alternative schedule.
When I tweak, Im saying to parents: You are in charge. I know that you love your child and want to do the best thing. I may not agree with your choice, but whats most important now is that we do something and keep talking.
See, when we hold a firm line, when we say that its our way or the highway, its a bit of a conversation-stopper. Thats why I would never turn away a family that is hesitant about vaccines. Id rather keep talking. Id rather keep them in a practice where there is some herd immunity to protect them, rather than sending them to a waiting room full of unvaccinated children (its these clusters of underimmunized children that can worsen epidemics). Id rather be sure that I am keeping the child healthy, and helping the parents, in every way I can.
Ive had families who initially didnt want to give vaccines change their minds and give them, or at least give more than they initially planned. If I hadnt been willing to listen to and work with them, if Id sent them away, that wouldnt have happened.
So much of this is about trust: Helping families trust not just me, but all the research and science behind vaccines, helping them trust the people who truly are experts as opposed to the people who say they are, but arent.
We dont build trust by drawing lines in the sand, no matter how strongly we might believe in those lines. We build trust by listening, understanding and, when needed, compromise.

140,yes_44.txt,"Amy Mitchell Meza: Community needs deeper reporting on vaccinations
I would like to applaud the Sentinel for running two articles about vaccines in the Feb. 18 issue one from Associated Press reporter Mike Stobbe, the other by Sentinel reporter Jondi Gumz. The contrast in vaccination rates among county schools quoted in Ms. Gumzs article is almost unbelievable, ranging from 100 rates rates found in some South County schools, to rates as low as 27 percent in one area private school!
While I appreciate Ms. Gumz reporting in general I am disappointed she didnt take the additional steps of challenging some common assumptions illustrated in Sundays article. For example:
The conception that drug companies make billions of dollars from vaccines: Actually, vaccine manufacture is surprisingly unprofitable for a number of reasons including the fact most vaccines are administered only between two to five or six times in ones lifetime, so the profit margin after research and development is much lower with vaccines than for some other drugs. The manufacturing and distribution processes are also quite costly.
In the U.S. the number of companies manufacturing vaccines has gone from dozens in the 1950s to a handful today. The nonprofit American College of Preventive Medicine continually monitors and makes strategic recommendations regarding vaccine supply as it relates to public safety. If even one of the manufacturers currently supplying vaccines in the U.S. were to pull out of production because of marginal profitability or for some other reason, such as manufacturing difficulties, the public health safety net of crowd immunity would rapidly begin to crumble.
Why bring the suggestion from a blogger that The anti-vaccine movement should be ridiculed into the article? I dont think this represents the position of many health professionals and vaccine proponents, and inserting it here only serves to provoke further division and to discourage real discourse.
Was county Schools Superintendent Michael Watkins position minimized in the article, or is saying that he simply has to accept of the opinion of the county health officer, Dr. Lisa Hernandez, (that the measles vaccine is not harmful) really the best he can muster? In light of the fact we are talking about area schools with abysmal vaccination rates, it would seem that school officials need to take a more informed and unequivocal leadership role in this conversation. My questions for Mr. Watkins and other school administrators are these: Are letters routinely sent by school districts to all families whose children attend schools with low documented vaccination rates? Are teachers and other school employees aware of the risks to themselves and their families? Do local districts monitor the vaccine status of employees?
Some childhood diseases like measles and chicken pox are airborne, which means one is not protected by hand-washing and other such precautions. A parent entering a school with an infant too young to be vaccinated may not even realize that infection could result without direct contact to a child who has already contracted one of these diseases. Whats worse is that often the most infectious period occurs in the days before the disease is likely to be diagnosed.
Ms. Gumz also quoted a local naturopathic doctor in the article, who was questioning whether 113 cases in a state as large as California is an epidemic. Yet, as a reporter not only did she not present any contrasting statement from any other health professional, but also (astoundingly) ended the article on that note!
A quick Internet search reveals these 113 cases were not sprinkled lightly across time and the vast state of California. The number 113 (updated Friday, Feb. 13) only refers to cases that have emerged in California during the past two months, and so far (according to the California Department of Public Health) are limited to only 12 of Californias 58 counties. In fact, 80 of the 113 cases were found in four Southern California counties closest to the high-profile outbreak associated with Disneyland.
I hope the Sentinel will continue to offer a public forum for this important conversation, and that reporters will take the time to assure a well-rounded representation of facts and opinions.

141,yes_46.txt,"Lets stop playing politics with vaccines
Politically motivated fearmongering about vaccination is putting children in our community in danger. During the Republican presidential primaries leading up to the 2012 election, former representative Michelle Bachmann criticized Governor Rick Perrys mandate for the HPV vaccine, which protects against a cancer-causing virus. She claimed at the time that she had met parents who believed that the vaccine gave their daughters mental retardation. These statements introduced a new precedent of injecting issues of vaccine safety into presidential politics. The American Academy of Pediatrics made emphatic statements at the time to clarify that the HPV vaccine does not cause mental retardation, but by this point the damage had been done: fear had taken hold in parents minds.
In 2015, with the presidential election around the corner and a widespread measles outbreak on our minds, the dangerous mix of immunization paranoia and politics continues. Senator Rand Paul, physician and presidential hopeful, claims to have met many tragic cases of walking, talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines, a statement that is dubious at best. His words are grounded in a fraudulent study that has long since been retracted and its author now discredited. Governor Chris Christie has also entered into the debate by stating, parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so thats the balance that the government has to decide. By employing the rhetoric of individual rights and a fear of big government, those in public office often attempt to score cheap political points and win public acceptance. Politicians like Senator Paul and Governor Christie are brandishing discredited ideas as tenable arguments against clear evidence-based recommendations to vaccinate, sowing confusion amongst parents.
According to the World Health Organization, measles is a leading cause of death worldwide, despite the universal availability of a widely researched and safe vaccine against it. The disease killed over 145,000 individuals, most of them children under 5 years of age, in 2013. Immunization against diseases like measles not only protects those that receive the vaccines but also helps to protect those who are not eligible to receive them, such as young infants and children with deficient immune systems. It is these children who are also at the highest risk of grave complications ranging from encephalitis to pneumonia, and depend on the rest of us to protect them.
It is no secret that vaccination rates across the country are falling. Based on CDC data, the nationwide measles, mumps and rubella vaccination rate among 19-35 month-olds is 91.9%, down from a rate of 92.3% in 2006. Rates are falling most in Ohio, Missouri, West Virginia, Connecticut and Virginia. It is very possible that more and more parents will choose to opt out of immunizing their children for fear of side effects, thanks to the dissemination of groundless claims. In response to the current epidemic, the American Academy of Pediatrics has released a recent statement once again exhorting parents to vaccinate their children, reiterating what they have said for decades: the measles vaccine is safe and effective.
We are already burdened with a wide number of celebrities, discredited researchers, and physicians relying on anecdotes and hearsay who are more than willing to use the vaccine controversy to gain quick publicity. Politicians should be clear to the public on the proven science of vaccines and should avoid muddying the waters further. It would be better for the candidates, too: it is widely believed that Michelle Bachman lost credibility because of her statements on vaccines in 2008. Senator Paul and Governor Christie should learn a lesson from her failure and be willing to communicate a clear message to the public: vaccines are safe and are effective at protecting against dangerous diseases.

142,yes_47.txt,"Epidemic shows vaccine's weakness
Whooping cough records set in 2010 and 2014 have some questioning booster schedule
San Diego County saw more than 1,900 whooping cough cases in 2014, a record that far outpaced the last historic outbreak.
That was in 2010. Two records in four years.
This alarming level of virulence has public-health officials recalibrating their thinking about a disease that causes coughing bouts severe enough to break a rib and is especially deadly for infants.
It has become increasingly clear that a whooping cough vaccine adopted a decade ago, while causing fewer side effects, wanes more quickly than its predecessor.
As researchers test new vaccine candidates, some are calling for a more frequent booster shot schedule to help keep immune systems inoculated.
Dr. John Bradley, director of the infectious-diseases division at Rady Childrens Hospital San Diego and an active participant on several national committees, said two records in four years should heighten a sense of urgency in drug development and standards of care.
The fact that the epidemic is coming back gives the (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) and the vaccine companies more justification for doing the trials that are needed, Bradley said. It provides proof that what we saw in 2010 wasnt a fluke. Now were establishing a pattern.
BIG PUSH
Of course, its not like anyone has been sitting still.
After the 2010 epidemic, California doubled down on its vaccination efforts with the Legislature passing a new requirement that all seventh-graders receive a booster shot before returning to school in fall 2011.
There has also been a big public awareness push around infants, who are most susceptible to infection, with health departments telling pregnant women to get vaccinated in their third trimester so that some of their immunity is transferred to their child before birth.
The campaign has also worked to surround infants with a ring of immunity after birth, urging parents to make sure that anyone coming in to contact with their new arrival has had a recent booster.
Those campaigns do seem to have had some effect. While the 2014 outbreak generated a higher case load, there were fewer fatalities.
Statewide, 10 infants died in 2010 compared with three in 2014. Four years ago, San Diego County recorded one death, of a 1-month-old boy; there were none last year.
Dr. Wilma Wooten, the countys public health officer, said that while the effectiveness of the current pertussis vaccine doesnt last as long as a previous version, getting vaccinated does mean less severe illness for those who end up getting infected.
We definitely have had more numbers, but the good news is that the cases have been more mild, Wooten said.
Still, with the current vaccine situation, there is little hope of avoiding high caseloads every few years.
I think its going to be our new normal until we get a different vaccine, Wooten said.
EARLIER BOOSTERS
While there are several ongoing attempts to create new pertussis vaccines, theres also a debate about administering booster doses earlier.
Bradley, the infectious disease expert at Rady Childrens Hospital, said the high infection tally in 2014, taken together with a deadly year in 2010, will likely push national health policy toward modifying the current vaccination schedule.
He said theres a dialogue taking place between the FDA and vaccine manufacturers about administering the whooping cough vaccine booster shot at age 8 or 9 instead of between ages 10 and 12.
This current epidemic in California gives urgency to the fact that we need to give those vaccines earlier to prevent all the disease that were seeing, Bradley said.
But changing the schedule, and perhaps increasing the total number of booster shots received in childhood, is no simple matter.
After receiving a series of four shots at 2, 4, 6 and 18 months to build initial immunity, the first booster is administered between four and six years.
Giving another shot only five years later, Bradley said, is viewed with extreme caution by federal regulators.
Even though there has been no problem giving women a fresh booster for each pregnancy, Bradley said the FDA requires more data on the safety implications of a closer spacing between boosters.
The FDA is interested in both efficacy and safety, but this is something thats hard to study. You cant take 100 children who are susceptible and just put them on a different schedule, Bradley said.
And the public-health world is not yet ready to call for a wholesale change in the vaccination schedule.
In an email, the California Department of Public Health said it doesnt support a more aggressive schedule since additional boosters are not cost-effective because older children and adults rarely have severe complications from pertussis.
ON THE FRONT LINES
As it has become clear that the current whooping cough vaccine wanes more quickly, some health providers have voluntarily gotten booster shots for themselves more frequently.
Dr. Mark Shalauta, who practices family medicine at Scripps Clinic in Rancho Bernardo and serves on the countys public-health advisory committee, said he has increased his own booster schedule to once every five years. Scripps recommends that schedule for any health workers who are regularly in contact with children.
Adults are free to receive the shot more frequently than the current practice of once every 10 years, Shalauta said.
Working on the front lines with adults and children, he has seen plenty of whooping cough consequences in recent years.
It can become very severe if its not treated relatively quickly. Patients can have coughing spells that are so severe theyre almost throwing up. Ive definitely had people break ribs because theyre coughing so violently, he said.
The key to avoiding sever symptoms, Shalauta added, is not waiting to long to seek treatment. Antibiotics can kill the pertussis bacteria, but only if the treatment course is started in time.
Once youve had it for a few weeks, antibiotics arent going to make a bit of difference, he said. You definitely want to get on an antibiotic prescription within the first 21 days.
But theres no reason to head into the doctors office after a single day of coughing. After all, a cough is a major symptom of the flu, which traditionally reaches its seasonal peak in the winter months.
Coughs accompanied by body aches and fevers tend to be signs of influenza, Shalauta said.
If you dont have a fever or aches and youve been coughing for several days to the point where you feel like youre going to throw up, or you cant catch your breath, its a good idea to head in for a checkup, he said.",43,55,22.636363636363637,0,0.7639983365381205,0.41714651053732177,0.08669640019882557,0.08484824948994689,0.2727272727272727,0.3061675941178503,0.3160618331886281,0.08443807367862052,0.26119354205136214,0.19063770657332688,0.1977954856461834,0.05669804687899204,0.14744797254000547,0.04016264925590022,0.342465669148285,0.06796940552146565,0.12378219287525308,1.0625178016461427,0.21034532900250094,0.15877649747179576,1.355241832514944,0.26936372108690815,0.16035899364932918,1.3570873315361174,0.27094224039341064,0.014814814814814814,0.030398671096345514,0.029850746268656716,0.05948037589828634,3.213303154966219,3.605865183677849,0,0,1.1448453411376205,6.447884459739346,9.200233132639106,2.720307012655365,0.9476579681847926,0.04088519573157619,,1.1335030507788528,-0.009252772828177222,-1.3163497984290593,-1.3267241945120791,0.2979202824506074,-2.0055052740907504,-1.5236106396966422,-1.4600794281819462,-0.5912503755529759,-0.9892459222187355,0.07565933156115646,-1.28584416388762,-0.6460270412136724,-1.3262000219671353,-1.333701297877148,-1.3438638686886977,-0.05557757209432753,0.02710403823063953,-0.040781412145157375,0.14025271721158744,0.4048084270456629,0.17716242874223626,0.34229710907883615,0.4676198845223697,0.3577436746894996,-0.49854843242633345,-0.05006418127045153,-0.2273032829232366,1.2269122975652411,0.8819741071311443,0.7009552034097669,,,-0.057006861106531005,-0.3822223600559889,-0.38224945145879474,0,-6.1861979954034405
143,yes_49.txt,"Anti anti-vaccine, or why I get my kids vaccinated: Multitasking Moms and Dads
I don't get the anti-vaccine movement.
I cannot fathom why any parent would balk at protecting their kids from vicious diseases like measles and polio.
Yet anti-vaxers have enough power to get a loophole in a new state law that mandates vaccines for children in licensed childcare facilities. Parents can object ""based on reasons of conscience or religious convictions.""
Why object?
Parents may mistakenly believe vaccinations could cause autism -- a link that has been thoroughly debunked. Or, as explained by a nonprofit organization called the National Vaccine Information Center, they may be committed to ""protecting bodily integrity and defending the inalienable right to self-determination.""
Self-determination? Right. So are these parents also protesting government requirements to buy car insurance, buckle our seat belts, educate our kids?
Vaccines are safe and effective. Side effects are rare. 
Kids should be vaccinated not only to protect themselves from deadly diseases, but to protect other people - including adults with immune deficiencies and infants, who don't receive the MMR vaccine until age 1.
An estimated 66.8 percent of Ohio children age 19 to 35 months received the combined vaccine series including measles-mumps-rubella, according to the 2012 National Immunization Survey. The national average was 68.4 percent.
No one's arguing that shots are pleasant. I held my kids while they got stuck on their chubby little thighs, four times in a row, and did that big air-gulping thing before they screamed bloody murder. I hated seeing them hurt.
But the fleeting pain is necessary to protect them from potential, real harm.
You don't want to get a flu shot? Fine, no problem.
But for the big-deal diseases, mass immunization matters. Without it, we get measles outbreaks, like the one in Disneyland in December, which infected more than 150 people in 17 states, and the hundreds of mumps cases that started at Ohio State University last March.
These diseases are not nostalgic childhood rituals like chicken pox (which now too can be avoided with a vaccine). They can be life-threatening.
At least the outbreaks may put an end to opt-out clauses like the one Ohio just added. Lawmakers in at least 10 states are promoting legislation that would make exemptions far harder to obtain, Reuters reports.
Regardless, the issue keeps circling through media, as if there's a real debate.
Jimmy Kimmel, who has an infant daughter, last month created a montage of doctors urging (and cussing at) parents to get their kids vaccinated. He followed up with video satire of two community activists promoting a ""child's right to choose"" whether they want to be vaccinated. (Spoiler alert: 100 percent of children prefer lollipops to shots.)
Debating vaccines is as senseless as debating climate change, or evolution.
I'm with actress Kristen Bell, who spoke recently about having her daughters vaccinated.

144,yes_5.txt,"Anti-vaccine parents lacking trust in medicine
In a community known for embracing science and discovery, it is a seeming contradiction: Flagstaff has joined the scientific consensus behind human causes of global warming and the need to intervene with solar panels, electric vehicles and curbside recycling.
But it also has one of the lowest childhood immunization rates in the state, with some kindergarten classrooms falling below 50 percent.
Whats behind the apparent disconnect and how should it be addressed if at all?
We are on record in this space as favoring vaccinations against those diseases deemed by public health officials as most threatening not only to children but the general population, especially the very old, the very young and those with compromised immune systems. The eradication of smallpox and polio is a tribute to modern medicine and effective public health campaigns, and we hope measles, mumps and rubella will soon follow.
But unlike some commentators, we have not been as strident when addressing. our local non-vaccinators usually parents of young children who have sought waivers for personal reasons. For starters, they are numerous enough to likely be a friend, neighbor or someone we know, so why not just talk to them? And as several studies have shown, those who wish to persuade the outliers on this issue to come in from the cold wont succeed through ridicule or scorn, which can have the opposite effect.
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY
Those studies have found that although the reasons for refusing vaccinations are varied (too many, too soon, too unsafe), they come down to two factors: A strong belief in taking personal responsibility for ones health coupled with a distrust of modern medicine. The result, in some classrooms, is a loss of the so-called herd immunity that occurs when a vaccination rate falls below 90 percent, thus increasing the risk to those in the general community who are not (or cannot be) vaccinated.
In some ways, it is hard to blame modern parents for making those kinds of choices for their children. They have been told, on the one hand, that choosing a healthy lifestyle is even more important than choosing a doctor; on the other, they are told of incompetence and carelessness in hospitals to the point where American medicine is now one of this countrys least trusted institutions.
The growth of the Internet also plays a role in the growing health care choice movement. It has democratized access to specialized scientific sources but not necessarily to authenticated or even accurate medical information. The disease of the month often comes with its own range of quack cures, leaving citizens to wonder whether cellphones cause cancer, sunscreens protect against melanoma and hormone replacement therapy is good or bad to name just a few. If modern medicine has already failed them, they say, why not turn to the Internet?
HOW FREE THE CHOICE?
Personal choice, of course, is grounded in an American credo of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. (Comparing that to the Canadian motto peace, order and good government might help explain why Canadian health care is organized so differently). But as Aristotle noted, one is responsible for acts only freely or voluntarily chosen. When a system does not provide sufficient or accurate, unbiased information, it can be argued that choosing a harmful health-related behavior like smoking or drinking alcohol is not entirely free.
There is also the consideration that, as John Stuart Mill noted, some lifestyle and personal health choices are not just self-regarding but other-regarding they have social and, in the case of vaccination refusal, medical implications for the community. Accepting responsibility for ones own health doesnt mean doing it in social or moral isolation.
Sociologist Robert Bellah, in his pathbreaking Habits of the Heart, found this communitarian component at work even in those whose idea of what is good or right was lodged mainly in individual choice. When everyone who smokes is treated equally (say, with higher taxes or a ban on indoor public spaces), at least it preserves a private choice while respecting the choices of non-smokers, too.
BLENDED APPROACH
In the case of vaccines and herd immunity, however, there might not be much room for anti-vaccine personal choice. About 20 states (including Arizona) still preserve personal waivers, but some now propose having parents meet first with a health professional before they can apply. Others say the focus should be on making sure doctor-patient relationships are improved from the assembly-line model common to many high-volume family practices, but that requires a major overhaul to restore quality access to preventive care.
The way forward, say social scientists who have studied the problem, is a blended approach to public health that mixes personal with social responsibility in a health care environment that has respect for both. When everyone is participating in a system that gives them meaningful ways to improve their health, both personally and through organized medicine, its easier to get buy-in to a medical consensus on something as vital at mass inoculation but also susceptible to misinformation and manipulation.",17,34,28.323529411764707,0,0.601900787741849,0.3507865170114831,0.23300959739614935,0.2357921037530782,0.29411764705882354,0.3394972666984006,0.33096573726246403,0.24531356985131864,0.24209828108224568,0.20946172571608,0.18416451776309592,0.11005385929986312,0.13574803028157115,0.11251273720773015,0.9559179069210201,0.19170125391235882,0.10545248644114942,0.8885085744663461,0.17889967272381366,0.16744605167906432,1.3870864669837195,0.2803604907738076,0.161640145895779,1.3746256927608054,0.2747594962552392,0.008550724637681159,0.016487107663578252,0.031914893617021274,0.02127659574468085,3.029312255242426,3.4788947550645477,0,0,1.1237644732316863,6.575815606767474,9.114432496310943,0.09391666121572108,0.04040040130506874,1.169968128990168,,-0.24493926116100329,-0.5358384278315538,0.008261806398876416,0.06343908121786523,0.3826458736330545,-1.132991511429615,-1.043707051497832,0.06065284638497413,-0.8961576119605691,-0.3774303996803271,-0.6167006101322606,-0.37664599685071076,-0.9448367335419698,0.4079413425809865,0.46635732246775763,0.45219559744382537,-0.8200615349975052,-0.8611554062764745,-0.8353480904318217,1.0587088942669938,1.0437403724805416,1.1191789974684943,0.5177853306135384,0.8572661276499709,0.7617376139216333,-0.7064629822334424,-0.5173640132177795,-0.16429103025569206,-0.8703635634483905,-1.7264717835040972,-1.38521458177173,,,-0.4903317481326646,0.032935080583050065,-0.6827145885999533,0,4.115219940851851
145,yes_50.txt,"Reagan: The consequences of your vaccination decision
California is experiencing an entirely new disturbance in the Force.
The Magic Kingdom has become the Measles Kingdom. Disneyland is ground zero for the largest outbreak of measles in the last 15 years. So far more than 100 cases have been reported since the initial exposure, some from as far away as Boston. (Rest assured, Mickey and Goofy are still fine.)
This makes last years fear of an Ebola outbreak spreading across the nation look even more prescient and the sleepy, lethargic response of the CDC look even worse.
Measles was so rare it was one of those diseases that I feared environmentalists would try to put on the endangered species list. When I was a boy, mothers used to have an informal measles network. When one child came down with it, the other mothers would rush their kids over to be exposed, so they could get the illness and be done with it. This was also the procedure with chicken pox.
But with the development of safe, effective vaccines, measles almost disappeared. I was anticipating a measles exhibition in the Smithsonian to mark the date when it finally vanished, but I didnt anticipate Jenny McCarthy would stop flaunting her boobs and start preaching to boobs.
McCarthy a former Playboy centerfold and a doctor whose medical license has since been revoked, began warning the public about a nonexistent connection between measles and autism. Most of us simply ignored her misinformation, but a recent study showed the two demographics where McCarthys message made inroads were Americans with very little education and those with advanced degrees.
Presumably both demographics include Disneyland patrons.
As a result gullible parents have been refusing to have their children vaccinated. For a while this is fine. These parents are parasites depending on the good sense of those that do vaccinate their children to keep the disease rare enough to protect the unvaccinated. But now we may be past the tipping point where so many children are unvaccinated that epidemics can break out.
This means there is more to consider than the expense when contemplating being trapped inside a submarine on the Finding Nemo ride.
Some in the medical profession have taken note and are taking sensible steps. The Associated Press reports Dr. Charles Goodman, a pediatrician in Los Angeles, has banned unvaccinated children from his office: Parents who choose not to give measles shots, theyre not just putting their kids at risk, but theyre also putting other kids at risk especially kids in my waiting room.
And Dr. Goodman is not alone.
But there are complaints from mothers unhappy that little Typhoid Mary cant visit the doctor. Dotty Hagmier, founder of Moms in Charge, told AP that mothers are feeling betrayed and upset. Just like the moms whose kids become ill because of her negligence.
The decision to vaccinate or not vaccinate belongs to the parents, but the parents should also be responsible enough to live with the results of their decision and demand the rest of us be put as risk because they chose to take their medical advice from a Playboy bunny.",14,28,20.607142857142858,0,0.5843766694543538,0.33720572812238797,0.18466659608696187,0.18044162980679954,0.14285714285714285,0.366222998363647,0.3636406727961638,0.2406458478009926,0.2747259529757307,0.24256857337235516,0.19972182215331244,0.12866051684760338,0.17249489768636317,0.09836781508497916,0.8073915196618308,0.16411826067690563,0.11525965349781733,0.9476308771683707,0.1924270531579568,0.1663638801725269,1.3321263363646274,0.27161579938881447,0.15404687018410848,1.306471797117335,0.26324291558653884,0.023148148148148147,0.04109977324263038,0.07692307692307693,0.030303030303030304,3.1903904944808366,3.6219097875754165,0,0,1.209497230155079,6.747204986567351,9.333779972399633,-0.20912837933500703,-0.21881604637485239,-0.3619795421914722,,-0.3939605530084337,-0.6436058978485931,-0.4294000161365217,-0.4463279215527679,-0.21648509258567777,-0.4333576149741279,0.008421218323450491,0.01652956012005737,-0.3751690125616817,0.6986035304180372,0.17350405126096288,-0.05958327829164574,-0.006343200777815332,0.06890520253225962,0.03053495966200541,0.05180801131243366,-0.4110303285628229,-0.5593556419351318,-0.4935391727797513,0.9440631949553342,-0.05898175837775132,0.3700822711021258,-0.5223177905855771,-0.6568952613062118,-0.4571036058555927,-0.22195259817137483,0.30939385224083976,1.2096743607496447,-0.37483869040885864,0.5571404595086908,0.9645738131275577,,,1.2719361705335521,0.5891215756106061,0.0854180535926141,0,-2.848116996472118
146,yes_51.txt,"Rotavirus vaccination reduces rates of rotavirus infection: Baylor study
A new study by Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Childrens Hospital researchers shows that a vaccine for rotavirus in infants reduces the rates of infection.
In the study of children enrolled in an acute gastroenteritis (AGE) surveillance program, researchers found that healthcare providers who administered rotavirus vaccines to more of their patients saw lower rates of rotavirus infection than those who did not. Their report appears today in the journal Pediatrics.
This shows that there is an association between not being vaccinated and getting the disease, said Leila Sahni, immunization action plan coordinator at Texas Childrens and first author of the paper.
Rotavirus is a common case of childhood diarrhea and vomiting and a major cause of mortality in middle and low-income countries. Rotavirus vaccines were first introduced in the United States in 2006 and have a narrow age range during which they can be given. Infants must receive the first dose of this oral vaccine at their two-month visit. Researchers at Baylor and Texas Childrens have been monitoring patients who arrive at the Texas Childrens emergency center with AGE and noticed that a high proportion of rotavirus-positive cases were occurring among patients from a small number of individual provider locations.
They hypothesized that the vaccination coverage rates at these sites might be associated with the proportion of rotavirus-positive cases from that provider location.
Over a two-year period, researchers reviewed vaccination records for infants who came into the emergency room with AGE and determined which providers in the city had low coverage (less than 40 percent), medium coverage (40 to 79 percent) or high coverage (80 percent or more) for the rotavirus vaccine amongst their patients. They found that a little over 80 percent of patients in the surveillance program had received the rotavirus vaccine from 68 different locations. Of these locations, four locations were classified as low coverage, 22 were medium coverage and 42 were high coverage for the vaccine. Patients cared for by pediatricians at low-coverage locations had 31.4 percent of all rotavirus-positive patients compared to 13.1 percent and 9.6 percent in the medium and high-coverage locations, respectively. Patients from low-coverage locations were 3 times more likely to have rotavirus than patients from high-coverage locations
Of the four low-coverage locations, one was a neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU. The rotavirus vaccine is not administered in NICUs because it is a live vaccine that is given orally. The vaccine is not given to premature infants, and some remain in the NICU for the entire window during which the first dose of vaccine can be administered (up to 14 weeks and six days). Those infants who are discharged from the NICU before this time can receive the vaccine upon discharge.
Sahni notes the importance of providers administering this vaccine during the two-month visit and for parents to be aware of it.
Its the only vaccine that is given by mouth, so parents should ask about it during the two-month visit if they notice that their child did not receive it, said Sahni.
Others who took part in the study include Dr. Julie A. Boom of Baylor and Texas Childrens and Dr. Jacqueline E. Tate, Dr. Daniel C. Payne and Dr. Umesh D. Parashar of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The study was supported by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grant awarded to the Texas Department of State Health Services (CDC-RFA-CI07-70405ARRA09).",12,23,28.47826086956522,0,0.7238451885906133,0.5208038099316269,0.16833993999494445,0.16051582602991,0.08695652173913043,0.4439419431889311,0.4139189567806609,0.24597026066233715,0.3898020392372495,0.252887578027204,0.2225012947047288,0.1495737466805925,0.2143789220845238,0.07981790759370032,0.6780328183004267,0.13507324516149327,0.13717349659789682,1.1901199902142205,0.2341497397483789,0.1535552254546661,1.325273778553493,0.26306302081901617,0.15403983024007487,1.3219421287569413,0.2635381231047086,0.03125,0.022222222222222223,0.06521739130434782,0.04995374653098982,3.220064338556089,3.5893250971781723,0,0,1.2770340106464508,7.116641288144688,9.851103231168365,-0.4111584063688258,-0.43482975277478664,1.2006872349807893,,0.7920494106748388,0.8132977428854459,-0.57720949977698,-0.6298406639910584,-0.43790305836216575,1.6011912938301287,1.627374800760779,0.06686044750811439,1.4623304327378606,1.0339903135011355,1.3305454604094578,0.2967840857921509,1.0633503214156932,-0.37571294237704583,-0.34904348371875293,-0.36980191158807885,0.5029385708199595,0.6784709282074524,0.5607068000039712,-0.41289101100903064,-0.19647173640736817,-0.3625746227669058,-0.5232821000668169,-0.31319401544377795,-0.42586073074498676,0.04696001846539057,-0.32471722104340073,0.8523347452233554,0.7039281915809295,0.9778276606346176,0.4291956364242675,,,2.6601791929327545,1.7880026378454155,1.897031702910487,0,-8.572948808516804
147,yes_53.txt,"Editorial: Vaccination doubters are endangering more than their own children
Parents in the Santa Monica-Malibu School District should be on alert: The percentage of kindergartners who werent vaccinated last year because their parents dont like the idea of immunization reached more than 14%, well above the level considered safe to keep kindergartners there protected from disease. The number was almost twice as high in the wealthy enclave of Montecito.
If the only children who could fall ill as a result were those who hadnt been vaccinated, this wouldnt matter quite as much. It would be, as vaccine skeptics like to say, a personal, parental choice.
But thats not the way immunity works. Keeping children healthy requires the cooperation of the larger community. Remember that some children cannot be vaccinated for documented medical reasons, and that, furthermore, vaccines dont take in all children; a small percentage remains without immunity. Its the immunity of almost all the children around these vulnerable populations that provides for their safety thats the concept of herd immunity, which posits that the immunity of a crucial percentage of people will drastically reduce the chances that a susceptible, non-immune person will be exposed to the disease.
For measles and whooping cough, the benefits of herd immunity fall to what epidemiologists consider unsafe levels when more than 8% of children are unvaccinated.
So its galling to read about the advice given by Dr. Robert Sears in Orange County, one of the counties that saw an outbreak of measles this year. Sears believes in the value of vaccination, according to a recent story in The Times, but tells parents that so many others are vaccinating their children that the doubters dont have to. In other words, hes advising them that because herd immunity works, they can exploit the parents who are doing the socially responsible thing by refusing to do the socially responsible thing themselves. It may not be good for the public health, he admitted to parents at a conference. But for your individual child, I think it is a safe enough choice.
At the rate things are going, that could be dangerous medical advice.
Unfortunately, Sears is among the medical professionals parents can seek out under a new state law that requires them to receive information about vaccination before they can exempt their children from it. Perhaps the new law, a stronger form of which worked well in Washington state, will bring rates back up within a few years. If not, California should join the majority of states, which require vaccinations for all but religious reasons or allow no exemptions at all.
It would help if schools were required to report their annual vaccination rates to parents, along with information about herd immunity. Parents have a right to know the dangers at their schools when immunization rates fall too low. Maybe peer pressure from alarmed parents will persuade vaccine doubters to join in what is a community, not just individual, concern.",9,22,25.454545454545453,0,0.5771283266090211,0.41789749903615475,0.26336487741382036,0.27212711175282794,0.18181818181818182,0.3914399379447325,0.32896067249045735,0.2940565811433563,0.31252744438039926,0.23127875290811062,0.1980197019204563,0.15463353114690453,0.16051020282168477,0.12093953927921584,1.0228322831756955,0.20481910931095773,0.12258320206307459,1.0458332901863483,0.208334192616493,0.15524069501181748,1.3277680866162367,0.26476282731337614,0.16040561153046498,1.346322436926189,0.269992998046441,0.0078125,0.010309443642776975,0.03571428571428571,0.03383458646616541,3.0849630176306344,3.50720898877805,0,0,1.152493568570158,6.383162785352091,9.116119971886759,-0.7142034469195538,-0.4780324940547735,0.6003837437591055,,-0.4555988846405216,-0.0032934628652552364,0.28307608801819734,0.39807737431823886,-0.062163480074792145,0.22677868800086226,-1.1082698515460596,0.5214133238650813,0.22843354070660082,0.3316634336026469,0.08704798480381418,0.38300424726369126,-0.3124253083695417,0.6099212773220821,0.6627048005363826,0.6426109890379049,-0.1055843330249498,-0.05806486413932793,-0.09159866791013986,-0.23433166539623637,-0.14642584548638968,-0.21696405467224378,0.34868268040723055,0.22845838655306516,0.25728193753612005,-0.7309657653766807,-0.7248763731835817,-0.0483069388071896,-0.18096657977013755,-0.9375088365314065,-0.9200015435171848,,,0.10020522821269416,-0.5922547510465761,-0.6768052200683429,0,3.2550246732874917
148,yes_54.txt,"Parents: please, vaccinate your kids
I remember chicken pox. I remember how painfully itchy it was and how I sobbed and begged my mom to make it go away.
I was little, in first grade, if I remember correctly. I missed a week or so of school. It was horrible. The little itchy scabs left little scars on my body that faded over time.
I never had the measles. My folks vaccinated me right away, both of them having far too much experience themselves with diseases. If there had been a chicken pox vaccine when I was a child, I would have gotten it.
My parents loved me far too much to have allowed me to suffer needlessly from any disease if there was a vaccine available.
They were aware of the risks. A tiny percentage of people who get vaccines get sick from the vaccines. Thats how it is with all medicine.
But both of them had first-hand experience with many of the diseases the vaccines were preventing. With that knowledge there was no question that the tiny risk from the vaccine was better than the risk of getting the disease.
Thanks to my parents and others of my parents generation, people under the age of 50 have very little experience with those horrible childhood illnesses.
Most of us have no memories of the horrible rashes, the incredibly painful mumps or the coughs that go on until you are literally dying because you cannot breathe.
Unfortunately, that has led a lot of my generation and younger to stop believing that vaccines are necessary. And that, in turn, has brought back some of those horrible diseases.
I had a woman my age tell me that no one had ever died from measles. Shes wrong. In 2013 the World Health Organization says 145,700 people died worldwide from measles. Most of the victims were children under the age of five.
That startling ignorance of those diseases has led to the current measles outbreak. The mortality rate of measles is low, but some of the victims will likely die from the disease or later complications.
An outbreak of mumps has also hit Idaho. I wonder what the victims of that outbreak would pick given a choice between a poke in the arm or the full-blown disease.
Whooping cough outbreaks also occur with some regularity. Many babies have died when they contracted the disease, painfully coughing themselves to death, while their parents watched helplessly.
Sadly, it will take another generation of parents with first-hand experience of preventable childhood diseases to bring back the vaccination rates that nearly eliminated those diseases from this country.
In the meantime, Im not looking forward to attending the funerals of innocent children with foolish parents.",16,32,16.03125,0,0.5881014298647642,0.3558516372694641,0.26282706394946825,0.26097390318561037,0.1875,0.46407346352218437,0.3903935712578895,0.3135990853248923,0.39799192760062096,0.274658899825926,0.2180134633992608,0.18434451242425928,0.23694820256593327,0.10904481921515345,0.880890136588499,0.17962025371759083,0.1518645237913235,1.2544499355250944,0.2525772164251683,0.16978753531426027,1.4141830991922937,0.28393874712131334,0.16769651523782492,1.4082455710421304,0.2813398319577455,0.07058823529411765,0.2125,0.1702127659574468,0.08067375886524823,3.201242641664115,3.638781668110168,0,0,1.1141121768572748,6.640626174060539,9.329442513453197,-0.007098352301188288,-0.04600508125490497,-1.2704395262079466,,-0.36228600031053254,-0.4956452402345529,0.2782071221985744,0.2953585121797783,-0.03965824491695469,2.1282000279125066,0.869860737988595,0.7061457258886799,1.5931040436039836,1.7415986367621588,1.102594323877258,0.8892877896293995,1.6397565640926104,0.324819673899783,0.24620263651754393,0.27683092745511684,1.115662769558519,1.006853982446109,1.0263310122168747,1.30676664404343,1.5874082217294767,1.4257032643644316,1.3473678316301878,1.6041922000976885,1.4581582464783154,1.35265505958071,6.066855804417721,4.057529898469797,2.3903670743206717,0.7109917574113909,1.2417848753819618,,,-0.6887382015409331,0.24325594355348096,0.0702287117303875,0,-0.603060908314629
149,yes_55.txt,"Investments in equity will impact half a billion lives
Like many who work in global health and development, I look forward to the release of the Gates Annual Letter every January. Since 2009, Ive excitedly perused the letter to see what child health goals Bill and Melinda Gates are prioritizing for the year. The 2015 letter is bold and inspiring, with the Gateses betting that, The lives of people in poor countries will improve faster in the next 15 years than at any other time in history.
Their daring mindset and willingness to set ambitious goals calls to mind another big bet one undertaken 15 years ago, when languishing global immunization rates could no longer be ignored. Realizing the urgency of this issue, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Bank, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and a group of national governments, vaccine manufacturers, civil society organizations and business leaders pooled their resources and expertise to form a pioneering partnership.
Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance was born. Then called the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization and nicknamed the Childrens Challenge, Gavis simple yet monumental purpose was to reach every child everywhere with vaccines against preventable diseases.
At the World Economic Forum in 2000, Gavis founders outlined inequity in three key areas as barriers to achieving universal immunization. Since then, Gavi has worked to lower these barriers, leveraging an innovative business model that finances the introduction of new vaccines in developing countries, while simultaneously reshaping the vaccine market. The three inequities remain relevant today, however, and underscore the urgency and significance of what Gavi does.
1. Access.
The year Gavi was formed, 30 million children were born in developing countries without access to all the necessary immunizations, while nearly all children born in industrialized countries could count on immunization as a predictable part of growing up. In the 15 years since, Gavis immunization programs in the worlds poorest countries have reached 500 million children with vaccines and saved 7 million lives.
2. Availability.
During the 1990s, new vaccines were becoming available, but were not in use in developing countries because they were prohibitively expensive. On average, a vaccine took longer than a decade after its initial introduction to reach a child in the developing world. Today, 10 types of vaccines including those designed to protect against the two leading killers of children, pneumonia and rotavirus are reaching children in Gavi-supported countries at record speeds. (For a helpful visual reference, you can use Gavis new interactive data tool to see this unprecedented acceleration in vaccine uptake.)
3. Investment in new vaccines.
Historically, investments in vaccines against diseases most common in poorer parts of the world have not been prioritized. With the aim of correcting this imbalance, Gavi helps countries introduce vaccines against diseases that affect people in low-income areas, like Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever. Gavi has also agreed to consider support for a malaria vaccine if and when one is licensed, pre-qualified and approved for use.
Elevating equity in these areas has driven Gavi for 15 years, and will continue to generate global breakthroughs if momentum continues to build and the great news is that it already has.
Last Tuesday in Berlin, donors stepped up with a historic $7.5 billion commitment to fund Gavi. These record-breaking pledges will help save another 5 million to 6 million lives by 2020, and nearly double Gavis impact since 2000. Fifteen years after the original partners first committed, their bet will continue to pay off, in dividends of millions of lives saved and hundreds of millions of children immunized and counting.
Equity in health is a key priority at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and as part of their Big Bet, Bill and Melinda wager that we can cut child deaths in half and eradicate more diseases than ever before by 2030. With 1 in 5 children still lacking access to lifesaving vaccines, we need Gavi to make good on their predication.
Thankfully, donors agreed and, once again, went all in.",15,33,22.90909090909091,0,0.6665254458785057,0.4537034636843159,0.4247530549764633,0.4123531894551383,0.030303030303030304,0.3668219892900776,0.3538382043743073,0.24298093956862396,0.28553946807534447,0.19560575669377364,0.16981427825295745,0.1339781950766084,0.16192150201687067,0.10792247715039403,0.9389479804516457,0.18489823747633896,0.1162309287038437,0.9924132501699731,0.19753656879985837,0.15296555654484792,1.3230583408451826,0.2612440301591472,0.1525765653712776,1.3213365150120577,0.26022300776929636,0.023809523809523808,0.01933177933177933,0,0.024897400820793433,3.145918397754099,3.527597371499127,0,0,1.1109168946213481,6.1976860012408235,9.247026218867529,-0.10811336581809766,-0.002802339974918114,0.09503021650843403,,0.3046147810298242,0.28083717587475815,1.7441654290788036,1.6895320312371178,-0.6623030842837916,-0.4176770580842653,-0.30721686855291713,0.03860283727906307,-0.20250213934075137,-0.8277750823631406,-1.3455946311396372,0.031031465994624804,-0.27638155114564017,0.2979185345263591,0.4165623090226634,0.3534447727606963,-0.37052098809727546,-0.33075646699015976,-0.36443228325392824,-0.47536078046799196,-0.240922362033122,-0.5183948671425063,-0.7237155381464984,-0.32664881418222225,-0.7767113291433054,-0.2000005478336797,-0.42180936194367286,-1.1385573984231125,-0.6715919483612413,-0.07334212484159547,-0.585013086236575,,,-0.7544183870094727,-1.1941571710464798,-0.21838480344957886,0,3.3045833836170435
150,yes_57.txt,"Vaccination crisis leaves no room for pandering pols
Liberty is the happy outcome achieved when a people strike the right balance between individual choice and communal rules.
We may choose to drive to work at little cost to those who prefer to walk or ride a bicycle, but no reasonable person would argue that stopping for red lights should be optional for any commuter.
The reason is obvious: Those who ignore traffic signals endanger their law-abiding neighbors as well as themselves, and no community can afford that kind of liberty.
The so-called debate over mandatory vaccinations is not much more complicated than that. Vaccination rates above 90% have proven remarkably successful at immunizing every American from measles, mumps and a host of other dangerous illnesses. But when too many parents decide to opt out, that herd immunity is sacrificed. And those most endangered are the small minority of children with serious illnesses that render them ineligible for vaccination.
Presidential candidates and others in a position to influence public opinion should be as unequivocal about the wisdom of vaccinating healthy children as they are about the wisdom of stopping for red lights. In both instances, the benefits of universal compliance overwhelmingly outweigh any burden on individual liberty.
Instead, some politicians eager to curry favor with libertarians on the right and left are indulging the false (and arguably dangerous) notion that doctors have yet to establish that vaccinations are safe and effective for the vast majority of healthy children.
An epidemic of ignorance
While visiting a vaccine manufacturer in Cambridge, England on Monday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie annoyed his hosts and infuriated pediatricians worldwide by calling on policymakers to provide ""some measure of choice"" when deciding whether to require vaccinations for children.
Later the same day, Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who, like Christie, is jockeying for his party's presidential nomination, said in two U.S. television interviews that he thinks most vaccines should be voluntary, saying he knew of ""many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.""
Paul, who is also an ophthalmologist, managed to violate the ethical guidelines of both his professions in disseminating this libertarian paranoia masquerading as science.
Both candidates later attempted to walk back their comments by acknowledging the public health benefits of vaccinating children. But their remarks were red meat for a small but persistent community of anti-vaccination activists that is lobbying for more liberal opt-out policies.
There's no federal law mandating vaccination against any disease, but the Centers for Disease Control says all 50 states require that children entering public schools be vaccinated against some or all of the following: mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and polio.
Every state exempts children for whom vaccinations pose genuine health risks, including those afflicted by leukemia or a variety of auto-immune diseases. (This is, incidentally, the population most at risk when vaccination rates in the healthy population fall below 90%.)
Many states, including Michigan, also permit parents to opt out on ""philosophical"" or ""religious grounds.""
Allegations without evidence
Why many parents remain convinced that medical opinion is closely divided over the risk/reward ratio for vaccinations is a mystery on par with the misconception that climatologists have yet to reach consensus on the existence of global warming.
Those warning about the peril of vaccination can largely be categorized either as charlatans like Andrew Wakefield, who lost his medical license after peers concluded he forged data that purported linked vaccinations to autism, or professional ignoramuses like TV host Jenny McCarthy, who never had any medical credentials in the first place.
The medical evidence that vaccination poses a serious health risk for large numbers of children isn't just shaky; it's virtually nonexistent. Politicians who suggest otherwise are suffering from toxic levels of either ignorance or cynicism.
That's not to say that most anti-vaccine activists are stupid or uneducated. In fact, many low-education states, including West Virginia and Mississippi, have relatively strict vaccination mandates, while others with a higher percentage of degree-holders maintain liberal opt-out policies. Resistance to vaccine mandates has flourished in both blue and red states where ideologues exalt personal freedom and parental prerogative above the welfare of the herd.
But those who have ""philosophical differences"" with evidence-based public health policy are entitled to no greater consideration than those who find red lights inconvenient and constraining. And politicians who muddle the issue with vague appeals to freedom and parental autonomy pose a public health threat of their own.",21,31,27.70967741935484,0,0.722089629371961,0.5735419381089428,0.14220743283392892,0.142050888093691,0.0,0.35786823994879213,0.35760897878222103,0.14061164852723274,0.30669989638609174,0.17790152146839178,0.1625989316789121,0.057916055252361626,0.14793849453887567,0.06051200237005153,0.529244654541502,0.10548537665144342,0.138544033808793,1.1919421100298413,0.23958462365496702,0.15020049416289,1.29917753686164,0.25982859631084904,0.15302438171422925,1.3047293523303265,0.2611656697925563,0,0.008503401360544217,0,0.012900143334925944,3.058902671532922,3.4996804940929924,0,0,1.1490283293823504,6.656110922391517,9.599736887559885,0.4979767152833586,-0.08920782253489182,1.0480990230860263,,0.7771205167706633,1.231789974339487,-0.8137939153444054,-0.7998991187249397,-0.7823310051255915,-0.652070885650652,-0.1857984697440541,-0.9290789322556903,0.1353810520891,-1.4031955514678967,-1.7120848889225864,-1.2650889559682286,-0.6334993958351659,-0.8384514099607363,-0.7856339797481497,-0.7992917479661371,0.5601000819472056,0.6877722460828335,0.6980350724451543,-0.7682926387777995,-0.7200677126483066,-0.6396452138348897,-0.6623750582647897,-0.6956068066106506,-0.6769460113532411,-0.9902743599907043,-0.7855426857124286,-1.1385573984231125,-1.3302063164239877,-1.306967341213742,-1.0436974175202538,,,0.028975979669631367,0.29350647780856093,1.0167722300538382,0,-2.189374169725962
151,yes_58.txt,"Flu jabs 'waste of time' for 97 per cent of patients
The flu vaccine issued this winter has proved almost useless and is estimated to protect just three per cent of patients, health experts have warned.
The vaccine will only provide low protection against the main strain of the virus spreading around the UK, and was estimated to work in just three of cases in lab tests, compared with a more typical past effectiveness of 50 per cent, Public Health England (PHE) said.
It said the problem was caused by a mismatch between the A(H3N2) influenza strain used to make the vaccine and the main A(H3N2) strain that has been spreading around the UK this winter. PHE said recent studies in the US and Canada echoed the findings and linked it to genetic drift in the virus.
Deputy chief medical officer John Watson said: The latest data show that levels of flu are generally decreasing in the UK. We do see drift in the flu virus from time to time, but even so, I want to reassure people that it is still the best overall way to protect yourself and your family from flu, along with good hand hygiene.
Antiviral drugs are available and effective, and doctors should prescribe them for those at greatest risk of becoming seriously ill due to flu.
The findings on the viruss mid-season effectiveness are published today in Eurosurveillance, based on analysis of 1,314 patients.
Study author Dr Richard Pebody, PHEs head of flu surveillance, said: The World Health Organization monitors influenza globally and each year recommends the strains of flu virus that should be included in the flu vaccine for the forthcoming flu season. It takes from February through to August / September to produce sufficient quantities of the flu vaccine. If a change in the virus is detected once production has started it is not possible to change it.
Throughout the last decade, there has generally been a good match between the strains of flu in the vaccine and those that subsequently circulate, so its crucial that these results do not discourage people in at-risk groups from having flu vaccination now, or in the future.
The current vaccine is still expected to protect against flu A(H1N1)pdm09 and flu B both of which may yet circulate this season, so anyone in an at-risk group should still get vaccinated if they have not already.
Its not possible to fully predict the strains that will circulate in any given season, and there is always a risk of a drift occurring as we have seen this year. However, its important to be aware that this does not occur every season. Flu vaccine is still the best protection we have against an unpredictable virus which can cause severe illness and deaths each year among at-risk groups, including older people, pregnant women and those with a health condition, even one that is well managed.
Our findings also mean that the early use of antivirals to treat and help prevent serious cases of flu in vulnerable patients is even more important this season.",12,18,31.444444444444443,0,0.7053351761663661,0.5384701377426098,0.1345222524056832,0.1419470529589388,0.5555555555555556,0.4034407103974973,0.3746753855452468,0.17154015055192368,0.360640516970721,0.21148385552148666,0.20056418115125288,0.09468266912070768,0.19561028980798734,0.0811752041423327,0.6449525304658089,0.13194989602987459,0.1413272561463157,1.2115743520832258,0.24294138812375013,0.15848405299827958,1.3462391397231195,0.27052003042039235,0.16001375028245862,1.355072712674953,0.27269114311986703,0.01904761904761905,0.008267195767195767,0.01694915254237288,0.02824858757062147,3.1030760434348745,3.5195527863328295,0,0,1.219395683681398,6.59358896364804,9.213852237546062,-0.4111584063688258,-0.6508434591747209,1.7895688297100916,,0.6346442894402007,0.9534851405564316,-0.8833698618444455,-0.8008554199388424,1.4181808769740734,0.5409383636561294,0.36373739701012275,-0.6367163764164505,0.9966882413006046,-0.31170743190425265,0.216290127180237,-0.6385754343752553,0.5840104142523133,-0.3431802370884369,-0.44611128071039846,-0.4151396386715564,0.6761809831814567,0.7879883363637818,0.7828535659793282,0.10927102810449892,0.22417805977694458,0.2762153853584494,0.2950067541529041,0.422861502565812,0.5428363505198488,-0.3580553102650845,-0.7934770084512203,-0.6211504006392846,-0.48762159129436955,-0.680719789915693,-0.7171885123695476,,,1.4754024734943596,0.09061252290659706,-0.33455672563847005,0,-1.7028510377428463
152,yes_59.txt,"Baker: Flu, not Ebola, is the epidemic we should be concerned about
Recently, the news has been dominated by the dangers and deaths from Ebola virus, with thousands of Americans being deployed to West Africa to fight Ebola. Yet we need to also be concerned about another epidemic, one that hits us every year: influenza virus or the flu, which killed more Americans last year than the current total deaths from Ebola in Liberia. While the severity of the flu epidemic is unpredictable, it always hospitalizes thousands of Americans and last year killed 107 children, almost half of whom were previously healthy; so far this year, five children have died. This month ushered in this year's epidemic in Texas. We also learned from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that the most frequent strain of the four influenza viruses, H3N2, is dominant so far. H3N2 flu is linked to severe influenza seasons, with high rates of hospitalization and death. Also, a little more than half of the patients with H3N2 flu disease so far have virus that has mutated slightly, making this part of the vaccine less effective.
You may think this change in one of the four flu viruses is a reason not to get vaccinated. This is simply not the case. The influenza vaccine remains the best way to protect yourself and your family from the flu, and it is better than other important strategies, like hand and cough hygiene and staying away from people with flu symptoms. Even with the mutated H3N2 flu circulating, this year's flu vaccine protects against other strains causing flu. While this year's vaccine could be somewhat less effective, opting for no vaccination assures no protection.
Getting the flu vaccine is especially important to protect the most vulnerable: pregnant women, children under two years of age, the elderly and those people with diseases or receiving medications that impair the immune system (e.g., cancer). Last year, only 52 percent of pregnant women and 70 percent of children under two were vaccinated. Pregnant women are five times more likely to have a complication from influenza that results in hospitalization than nonpregnant women of the same age. Vaccination not only protects the woman, but the antibodies created by the mother in response to flu vaccine pass through the umbilical cord and breast milk to the baby, protecting the baby before age 6 months when the flu vaccine can be given. Also, flu-vaccinated pregnant women have fewer premature and low-birth weight babies, and millions of flu vaccine doses given in the past have proven how safe this vaccine is for mother and baby.
While you may think that flu is no worse than other respiratory viruses common this time of year, flu is distinct. It causes high fever, severe muscle aches, fatigue, sore throat and in children sometimes vomiting and diarrhea, symptoms that last a week or more. Getting the vaccine not only protects, but if you do get the flu, the symptoms are less severe and don't last as long.
Every year, my colleagues and I care for far too many vulnerable infants and children who suffer needlessly from an infection that can be prevented. It's not too late to be immunized: The flu epidemic typically peaks in February and continues into the spring. Vaccine is still available; if your physician has no more supply, go to a pharmacy or the health department. It takes 14 days to be protected after vaccination, so readers who haven't already done so should take this opportunity to seek the flu vaccine as soon as possible.
We still anticipate seeing an increase in cases at our hospitals, so there is still time to protect yourself and your loved ones. Flu vaccine is truly the best personal protective equipment you can wear during flu season.

153,yes_60.txt,"HPV vaccines becoming a key part of sexual education on campuses
In the midst of anti-vaccination talks from all corners of the country, one vaccine has made headlines for making a more positive contribution.
Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines were previously thought to have increased dangerous sexual behavior such as promiscuity in young girls, but instead have been found to may do the opposite. According to a recent study from Laura Sadler, a research associate at the University of Manchester, getting the vaccine can actually help young girls have a safer sex life.
HPV vaccines are recommended for 11- to 12-year-old girls. The vaccine fights against nine strains of HPV, which can lead to cervical cancer.
The study shows that amongst women in our study, who were mainly from the catch-up vaccine programme (older teens), vaccination was taken up by those demonstrating other types of preventive or less risky behaviours (sic), Sadler said in an e-mail.
The news comes at a time during which the word vaccine can be polarizing. People against giving their children vaccines -- sometimes called anti-vaxxers tend to cite religion reasons or health concerns as the reasons for their wariness.
But HPV vaccines, such as Gardisil, fall into a different category given that they dont treat an infectious disease, such as meningitis.
Robert Bednarczyk, an assistant professor of public health at Emory University, says that he's not sure the study will ease naysayers minds, but nonetheless urges all parents to look at the untold benefits that occur when young girls get the vaccine.
RELATED: Flu virus mutation renders most vaccines ineffective
I think it really just highlights the mounting evidence of the preventative measures vaccines provide, Bednarczyk says. When you do get vaccinated and engaged in the healthcare system, you get engaged in a counseling system as well.
And its that counseling, University of Iowa senior Ada Vargas says, that needs to happen in schools across the country and at the collegiate level.
Its not something that is pre-planned, but when youre trying to prevent cervical cancer [talking about safe sex] does come up, Vargas says, an HPV vaccine recipient. Sexual education in the United States is so un-uniform, that even a little bit of an impromptu preparation would be helpful.""
Colleges have been making the changes that Vargas and so many others request. More schools, in addition to teaching students about alcohol safety, are also teaching students about consent and safe sex practices.
New York and California have rolled out specific policies and promotions to encourage students to abide by the consent rule yes means yes. Dartmouth University recently announced they will take a step even further, by requiring all undergraduate students to take a four-year sexual education program.
Some students have taken offense to these programs, arguing that they impart no new knowledge. The Dartmouth, the university's student newspaper, published an article explaining the program. Its comment section quickly filled with backlash.
""I wonder what the next step will be,"" one commenter wrote. ""I mean, where do you go after four years? Perhaps full-time monitors for every student? Ivy League -- stick a fork in it.""
But others, such as Vargas, say having early and frequent sexual education is key in decreasing sexual assaults and abusive relationships while increasing positive sexual behavior.
And the first step, she adds, is making sure girls get the HPV vaccine.
I think if it's not required, then definitely recommend (getting the vaccine before college),"" she says. ""And perhaps moving forward it could be a requirement. You can go into the world and people don't know this information until late in high school or college. Learning it earlier would be much more effective.""",19,34,21.352941176470587,0,0.6445855623619123,0.3205813939108118,0.23145560992130063,0.2291333816880197,0.08823529411764706,0.3224404732476399,0.3257278305015449,0.1951915456386562,0.2999591496342804,0.1989183775599926,0.20019998112674253,0.10556986745374934,0.21295512081851362,0.08975227613022865,0.7614173017840169,0.1544366433028056,0.15215386552823806,1.2707722881930206,0.25815466165718937,0.15816272120850267,1.3220364353438334,0.2678978306186424,0.15380782978229937,1.3140627038782497,0.2639824635671769,0.026570048309178744,0.10213032581453634,0.07865168539325842,0.06566791510611736,3.1625687009994317,3.564677132084724,0,0,1.1760483635749592,6.112370707629721,8.844350190316746,0.29594668824953985,0.04040040130506874,-0.21391490204187216,,0.11804278174367752,-0.7755247762973874,-0.005806848256833128,0.0021135577420942626,-0.43283794149799765,-1.5795091601310796,-1.2123669030885789,-0.4131432363012089,0.0277468874268634,-0.7201087624944836,0.19779125682139861,-0.45305448886910554,1.0269872686043473,-0.13759851988554642,-0.10436761646199326,-0.0887278390637036,1.127730454246484,1.090174184189667,1.1672615144158829,0.07522900470294458,-0.2614259125030715,0.051589815296554924,-0.5550607960360731,-0.4882496128656476,-0.3788345788991376,-0.10837459859808259,2.359455809571193,1.2624436137647628,1.5665901139353233,0.16270984915993272,0.024220709539811664,,,0.5843825841889152,-1.4710192157146624,-1.6285154658751582,0,-1.7923949978331701
154,yes_61.txt,"Confirmed cases of influenza, respiratory illness in Muskegon County on the rise
MUSKEGON, MI The 2014-15 influenza season is picking up its pace statewide and throughout Muskegon County.
The latest figures available from Public Health Muskegon County indicate that the department has documented a few dozen laboratory-confirmed flu virus illnesses since the first known episodea case of Influenza Awas recorded in late October.
As of Dec. 15, the local agency had recorded 57 cases since the flu season officially began during the fall season. Unconfirmed reports of influenza-like illness from local schools and daycares had also increased right before students left for winter break.
Public Health - Muskegon County Nursing Supervisor Pat Krehn said for the week ending Friday, Dec. 19, the educational facilities reported 682 flu-like illnesses compared to the 291 flu-like illnesses that were reported around the same time last year.
Mercy Health spokeswoman Joan Kessler confirmed Monday that the hospital system's emergency room personnel were seeing an increasing volume of influenza-related visits.
Meanwhile, the Michigan Department of Community Health's latest influenza report released Monday characterized influenza activity as ""widespread"" across the state. The department noted there had been 185 flu-related hospitalizations as of Dec. 20.
As of mid-December, Washtenaw County had already confirmed about 80 cases and 14 hospitalizations, while local hospitals in Wayne and Kent counties, among other regions, said they were experiencing higher-than-average emergency room flu-related visits.
Flu activity peaks between December and February but can begin as early as October and end as late as May, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Public Health Muskegon County spokeswoman Dori Peters said residents are urged to get one of the seasonal flu shots or intranasal sprays available at local doctor offices, drug store pharmacies or at the health department.
""It takes about two weeks for the body to build immunity after receiving the vaccination,"" Peters said.
The CDC strongly recommends that pregnant women, children 5 years and younger and adults 50 and older get the shot form of the vaccine and not the less popular intranasal mist.
The department has said that people who become ill even after immunization should expect milder ailments compared to the symptoms they would have experienced if they did not get the vaccine.
CDC scientists and doctors still recommend the seasonal flu shot to everyone 6 months and older although a newer strain caused by the mutation of the H3N2 influenza virus is not covered in the seasonal dosage release. Federal health officials said the ongoing influenza season is expected to be more severe than the last year because most diagnoses so far are caused by the more aggressive Type A strain.
The CDC said the quadrivalent vaccine, first made available in the United States in 2013, is designed to protect against two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses.
Most insurance plans cover the full cost of immunization, but doses for regular and quadrivalent doses are available for out-of-pocket prices between $15 and $50.
As of late December, Benson Sav-Mor Pharmacy, located at 961 Spring St., was running a $15 special for the regular trivalent flu shot. The drugstore is also selling the quadrivalent version of the flu vaccine for $25.
A store associate on Monday said the location had been out of Tamiflu, a common flu treatment and preventative medication, for about two weeks.
Krehn said Public Health Muskegon County had about 212 flu doses for adults left as of Tuesday, Dec. 30.
The agency also had about 155 free flu vaccine doses available through the Vaccines for Children program. In order to qualify for the federally-funded initiative, residents must be 18 years and younger and meet at least one of the following criteria: uninsured, underinsured, Medicaid-eligible, American Indian or Alaska Native.
Common symptoms associated with the contagious respiratory illness include fever, chills, cough, sore throat and runny or stuffy nose. However, signs can also include bodily aches, headaches and fatigue.
Local health officials said headache, fever and extreme exhaustion are more common among those fighting influenza rather than the common cold. Likewise, stuffy nose, sneezing and sore throat are more common cold symptoms.
Most flu-stricken people recover within a few days to just under two weeks but the minority may develop severe or even life-threatening complications such as pneumonia. Ninety percent of flu-related deaths occur in adults 65 years and older, according to the CDC.
CDC officials said the virus typically spreads to others within 6 feet mainly through droplets that disperse when someone coughs, sneezes or talks. A person may also obtain the flu virus by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their mouth or nose.
To help fight the virus, health officials recommend proper diet, good sleeping habits, staying away from sick people, thorough dish washing, avoiding facial touching and practicing good hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds.
Muskegon County experienced the most severe flu season since 2010 during influenza season 2012-13. During The final week of 2012, local health officials had recorded about 80 confirmed flu cases.

155,yes_62.txt,"Uganda's immunization programme needs a shot in the arm
Inadequate funding, a shortage of health staff and poor adherence to vaccination schedules are some of the reasons for declining immunization levels in Uganda, which experts say threatens efforts to reduce preventable deaths among children.
Ugandas national measles immunization coverage declined from 71 percent in 2006 to 55 percent in 2010, according to the UN World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Childrens Funds (UNICEF) 2011 estimates.
Routine immunization decline is due to health system issues that are affecting the entire health delivery, including limitations in the resource envelope, low staffing levels, inadequate capacities to manage the available resources, [and] vaccines- and related supplies-distribution challenges from national to district to operational levels, Eva Kabwongera, the technical officer in charge of immunization with UNICEF in Uganda, told IRIN.
The main challenge has been establishing an immunization programme that can function smoothly year after year as part of solid primary healthcare systems.
Major childhood diseases in Uganda include measles, tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, pertussis (whooping cough), diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae and neonatal tetanus. But some 48 percent of children under the age of five are un-immunized or under-immunized - meaning they start immunization but do not complete the schedule - according to the 2011 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey.
The re-emergence of these diseases in Uganda is due to accumulation of non-immunized children because parents and caretakers have not been taking the children for immunization, said a government statement.
Barriers to immunization
Between 2000 and 2007, the percentage of children receiving the final dose of the DPT3 (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) vaccine increased from 56 percent to 85 percent under Ugandas Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI). Investments into the programme, including from the GAVI Alliance and Sustainable Outreach Services, contributed to that success, according to the ministrys Health Management Information System report.
But Ugandas budget support for the EPI subsequently decreased by more than half - from 7.7 percent in the 2006-2007 financial year to 3.6 percent in 2009-2010. And recent challenges in routine immunization service delivery have resulted in reduced vaccination coverage, with DPT3 coverage, for example, falling to below 80 percent over the 2007-2011 period.
Added barriers
In rural areas, culture, religion and long distances to health centres are added barriers to immunization. 
There are several new religions in Uganda that mislead our people. Their leaders preach to them not to immunize or treat their children when they are sick. They believe God will heal them, Huda Oleru, a member of parliament (MP), told IRIN.
We have had dialogue [with] Gospel Church leaders in Mbale [eastern Uganda]. For them, they dont want their children to be immunized. They believe that the immunization vaccines are made [from] wild animals, which will make their children sick.
Some of the people in Karamoja in the north, and in the Mount Elgon and Mount Rwenzori regions, failed to immunize their children because of cultural reasons, Oleru added. A majority of them have never been immunized and are still alive. So they are wondering why they should immunize their children.
According to Philippa Musoke, the principal investigator for paediatric infectious diseases at the Makerere University-Johns Hopkins University Clinical Research Site in Kampala, most of the health centres where immunization services are carried out are very far from peoples homes.
It requires mothers to have money for transport, which most of them dont have. People only take children [for immunization] during national immunization days, Musoke told IRIN.
The challenges need to be handled using [a] multi-approach. The Ministry of Health needs to sensitize the community about the benefits of immunization, ensure the services are taken nearer [to] where they can get them easily. We need to use the village health teams to strengthen immunization in the community.
More health investment is also needed.
The current government allocation to [the] health sector is too low, affecting its allocation to key programmes like immunization, Musoke said. We encourage the government to increase [the] health budget so that our people, especially children - our future leaders - live a healthy life.
According to UNICEFs Kabwongera, The government needs to give incentives to health workers in order to encourage them to work in rural areas and strengthen the health systems. Recruit low cadres in order to strengthen the health systems in rural areas.
Gaps in the system
Uganda also risks losing the gains it has made in its national polio eradication programme, according to a November 2012 report, which noted that districts surveillance teams lack the training to help track polio and suspected polio cases at health facilities and in villages.
There are a lot of gaps in the health system, and this requires redress for the country to realize its mandate of eradicating polio, Joseph Munaba, a member of the Uganda Polio Eradication Team at the health ministry, told IRIN. The team is tasked with improving wild polio surveillance in districts perceived to be at high risk along the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and South Sudan borders.
A monitoring visit in the northern Agago District in 2012 revealed that health centres there lacked essentials items, including containers for collecting specimen from suspected polio cases, and that health workers also lacked necessary knowledge, Munaba said.
That many women give birth away from hospitals is also a problem.
There is a challenge in Uganda where so many mothers in the rural villages do not attend antenatal care, and their children miss out [on] immunizations. This presents a dangerous situation because Uganda is bordered by countries with reported cases of wild polio, Emmanuel Tenywa, the WHO northern Uganda regional officer, told IRIN.
Uganda had been polio-free since 1996, but recorded a re-emergence of the disease in 2009, when eight cases of wild poliovirus type 1 were reported in the northern districts of Amuru and Pader.
Measures to improve vaccination
On 20 November 2012, MP Oleru submitted the Immunization Bill 2012, which seeks to impose penalties and fines on parents and guardians who fail to take their children for routine immunization against the major childhood diseases.
The decline of immunization in Uganda is majorly [based] on the attitude of the parents. So we need a law to force them to routinely take their children for immunization, Oleru told IRIN. People should support the bill. They shouldnt look at it as a punishment. We need to protect the children; the future of this country belongs to them.
Expressing support for the bill, Ugandas state minister for primary healthcare, Sarah Achieng Opendi, said, There is no compromise on immunization of our children. As government, we shall support the bill once it comes to the floor of parliament for debate. We want to ensure that every child in Uganda is fully vaccinated with high-quality and effective vaccines against the vaccine-preventable diseases.
Ugandas health ministry has established a quarterly national child-and-family day during which immunizations are carried out; it is also partnering with churches and mosques. With national campaigns and doing immunization during Friday and Sunday prayers, we believe we shall be able to reach 90 percent coverage in immunization from the current 52 percent, Opendi told IRIN.
The government also plans to introduce the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to fight pneumonia in 2013. Having realized that pneumonia is one of the major causes of infant deaths, we shall begin to vaccinate children against the disease, Christine Ondoa, Ugandas health minister, was quoted as saying in Ugandas New Vision newspaper.
Vaccines for rotavirus and human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes cervical cancer, will be introduced in 2014. If we vaccinate girls when they are still young, we shall be lowering their chances of getting cervical cancer, Ondoa said. The HPV vaccination campaign is already being piloted in 12 of the countrys 112 districts.",35,61,24.639344262295083,0,0.6994785850246747,0.43969997541159594,0.24225119320409638,0.24189107110102973,0.3114754098360656,0.3527773218612552,0.3586663873365798,0.2496731880955995,0.27008156609442335,0.2177875291650431,0.1959982474451537,0.1361690498156911,0.17504269875977685,0.10147757613870104,0.8013954211990661,0.16540073707157427,0.12495403691988788,1.0415271217980255,0.2116421244708592,0.16016288816724306,1.3603997294095878,0.27383597081395805,0.16267489480014308,1.3652293610843946,0.27446860991165656,0.0498062015503876,0.03551638837353123,0.02564102564102564,0.03535848440307039,3.144818900363818,3.537937189931232,0,0,1.1232984177405023,6.6313001693334686,9.177069770061129,1.9121869045200897,1.2068744158647138,0.43854043028948214,,0.584841111703159,0.1697154645450078,0.09192838801165082,0.11960937359835581,0.4513986074614336,-0.7853424047518796,-0.15175006491570223,0.10186367293466593,-0.4493291495232784,-0.10682635125422436,-0.01562807713547792,0.06836425173323994,0.05872615068087515,0.14344229612515638,0.012940552042720033,0.07042410651097307,-0.0067030316117751,-0.08004642685619157,-0.00801407351565701,0.2871275238744425,0.5082966646160647,0.5602688738450561,0.659521994202918,0.6485097170601067,0.7309520642842835,0.6628681842773043,0.12184377394541364,-0.35581347869886015,-0.09730903737854614,-0.08892974060817878,-0.4151261524607199,,,-0.4999116878185607,0.21299153692679215,-0.463365200845816,0,1.8673372945500346
156,yes_65.txt,"Vaccinations and your government
In a recent interview with NBC News, President Barack Obama declared his stance on the now decades-old controversy over the dangers of disease vaccination. I just want people to know the facts and science and the information, said Obama in reference to parents who refuse to immunize their children from deadly diseases. The fact is that a major success of our civilization is our ability to prevent disease that in the past have devastated folks. And measles is preventable. His last point is why this issue requires our attention.
During 2014, the United States had a record number of measles cases, with 644 cases from 27 states reported to Center for Disease Controls National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). For scale, this is the greatest number of cases since measles was eradicated in the U.S. in 2000.
Let me be clear: Measles was eradicated from the U.S. in 2000.
Now, 15 years later, because of bogus science and misleading rhetoric propagated by both our media and certain political figures, a completely preventable disease once again threatens public health. And it shouldnt. The science is indisputable: Vaccinations do not cause autism and are not a public health threat. But the debate, and the subsequent public insecurity it provokes, is. So the question rises: What should we do? And better yet, what should our government do?
Although it might effectively resolve the issue, it is not within the federal or any state governments authority to immunize all children without the consent of their parents with no exceptions. Some parents refuse to immunize their children because they are misled by incorrect science, but many opt out of vaccination due to religious reasons. We as Americans do have that right.
Nonetheless, it is the responsibility of our government to preserve public safety. We can not and we should not forcibly immunize children, but we can conform state law to require immunization against contagious diseases as an unconditional requirement for enrollment into public school systems. Seeing as how the federal government is crippled by political obstinance, the more effective route might be through state legislatures, where gridlock is bad, but not as bad.
Either way, our governments must act quickly. Children, who have the least control over whether or not they are immunized, are also the most at risk for contracting disease, and because of this, making schools safe for students should be a top priority.
However, as exemplified by the measles outbreak that occurred at Disneyland in December, which, according to Reuters infected 58 people with the virus, the danger to public health posed by unmitigated disease outbreaks extends far beyond our classrooms. It isnt quite enough for our school districts to mandate immunization when there are limitless other public spaces where transmittable diseases can explode into an epidemic.
This is a public health issue, but it is also a public knowledge issue. Although our medias culpability in this problem is undeniable, they reside in the private sector. However self-serving it may be, we cant reform Fox News or CNNs agenda.
Unfortunately, the public sphere is equally as liable, but perhaps even less controlled. When we have politicians like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie calling for balance between public health interests and parental choice, this intentionally distorts the issue by implying that the debate is equally legitimate on both sides, and undermines the very purpose of government: to uphold public safety.
Frankly, the only way were going to eradicate measles again is if our elected officials stop co-opting issues of public health for political gain and speak the truth. This is why President Obama has the right idea. He leaves no room for misinterpretation when he says, There is every reason to get vaccinated there arent reasons to not. For this, I say, Thanks, Obama.",12,34,21.323529411764707,0,0.4759099992612998,0.28922269114960525,0.3054889839556482,0.2893774420022964,0.29411764705882354,0.3922516348050727,0.3704950239663611,0.3965541113547429,0.39202503970844366,0.1896844554932848,0.18265032529958733,0.17318691268295947,0.16367517614785104,0.14129554844947134,1.1779065845669272,0.2372984361214706,0.1374890896330434,1.185353493520573,0.2351336862422332,0.1487094249037601,1.289463713704609,0.2556599088430197,0.15447937236468015,1.305714768596224,0.26272517655835714,0.023148148148148147,0.0109006734006734,0,0.019672131147540985,3.039290047833392,3.4689634963591085,0,0,1.0875355989326578,6.612266429950562,9.191828296622806,-0.4111584063688258,0.04040040130506874,-0.21975407094917998,,-1.3163375336575718,-1.0243651115083372,0.6644366312715995,0.5569495306182908,0.3826458736330545,0.24802752205538448,0.22913034963938841,1.4903073193094054,1.4978266184826294,-1.0202283496814046,-0.6936112312076849,0.6991591274828721,-0.2315937380139484,1.0978294266910713,1.1177407688242094,1.1140724852514137,0.5161011282804877,0.654139542027743,0.5855690922806787,-0.9262571359969421,-0.9149662263498171,-0.9967475972025239,-0.46307499669536933,-0.67371401166791,-0.5118977923236554,-0.22195259817137483,-0.7050165229343633,-1.1385573984231125,-0.9584439799910145,-1.5850162434714772,-1.5483887323702699,,,-1.235029401605048,0.15122394778557632,-0.4116823358097667,0,9.08737661524038
157,yes_66.txt,"Vaccinated kids grow up as more productive individuals: Anuradha Gupta
Anuradha Gupta, a Haryana cadre IAS officer, was appointed as the deputy chief executive officer of Geneva-based Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi) in April 2014. She spoke to Chief of Bureau, Hitender Rao on Gavis role in driving down vaccine prices and why India needs to bring more vaccines under its Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP).
How has Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi) brought down the cost of vaccines?
Gavi has registered success in terms of shaping the vaccine market. It has driven down prices and encouraged vaccine manufacturing in developing nations. The prices in the open market are incredible. Gavi has actively contributed in expanding the numbers of vaccine manufacturers thus opening up the competition and thereby contributing to reduce vaccines prices. Secondly, Gavi very smartly aggregates demand. Because we work with 73 countries it gives us the advantage of pooling demand and leveraging volumes.
But why there is a huge price disparity in the vaccine market in India?
Very few people understand that vaccine gets licenced in private markets and therefore are recommended by the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP). Then they are widely prescribed by private doctors. But they are exorbitantly priced. It can be gauged from the fact that the price charged by private doctors for one dose of Pentavalent vaccine can range from Rs. 1,200-2,000 per dose. This means that for a full course of three doses it can cost Rs. 5,000 to 6,000. In comparison, the lowest price negotiated by Gavi globally is $1.19 per dose (Rs 60-70). The Gavi price for a full course of nine doses of three key life saving vaccines Rota, Pneumococcal and Pentavalent vaccines is $21 (about Rs. 1,200). However, in private market in India the cost of vaccinating one child with the full course of these vaccines can be as high as Rs. 25,000. Similarly, Hepatitis-B vaccine used to cost Rs. 1,500 for a full course of three doses some years ago. After it was introduced in the UIP, its prices fell to less than Rs. 3 per dose (Rs 15 for three doses).
Is there a way to bring down the prices of the vaccines in the open market?
India has the worlds largest birth cohort with nearly 2.7 crore births every year. Even if 30% of the children access vaccines in the private market it translates into huge numbers. The fact that introduction of a vaccine in UIP brings down the vaccine prices substantially is a pointer to the fact that in the absence of its availability in UIP, there is a likelihood of artificial jacking of prices. It is important that all those vaccines, which are available in the private market must be introduced soon in the governments UIP, which provides free of cost vaccination.
You often speak about the virtuous cycle in context of vaccine administration. What is it?
There is empirical evidence to show that high child mortality rates are co-related with high fertility rates. When children are vaccinated, their survival improves. Mothers become more confident of the survival of their kids resulting in declining fertility rates. They know that they do not need to produce more children as their kids will survive. Once the fertility rate starts to drop, the maternal health starts to improve and mothers are able to raise their kids better. Empirical evidence shows a strong connection between vaccinated kids and their performance at school. They grow up as more productive individuals with potential for higher earnings. 
What has been you experience about Haryana, a state where you have worked as a bureaucrat?
We are all aware that Haryana has progressed economically and yet has lagged behind on human development. A particular challenge is deep inequities within the state. The state needs to map its weak spots and prioritise them for resources and results.
What is Gavi
Founded in 2000, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi) is an international organisation bringing together public and private sectors with an aim to create equal access to new and underused vaccines for children living in the worlds poorest countries. Gavis endeavour is to close the gap in access to life saving vaccines and contribute to millennium development goal (MDG) 4 by reducing child mortality caused by vaccine preventable deaths.

158,yes_67.txt,"The Measles, Vaccines, and Immunity 2015
The measles is a very contagious respiratory illness that spreads from person to person through the air. When someone is infected with the measles they can easily contaminate others by failing to cover their mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing. The measles is caused by a virus or viral infection.
What are the symptoms of the measles?
The first symptoms of the measles are generally a fever, runny nose and sore throat. At the onset, the measles could be mistaken for a cold. After a day or so, the main symptom of the measles, a skin rash, will begin to spread all over the body.
Should I be concerned about catching the measles?
There is no simple answer. It really depends on your overall health and the strength of your immune system. Most healthy people experience symptoms of the measles for about 3 days and recover without complications.
Will getting vaccinated for the measles protect me from the disease?
Measles vaccinations may offer some protection from the measles, but there are no guarantees. People who are vaccinated from the measles may need to have periodic booster shots to help maintain immunity. Unvaccinated people who contract the measles will develop life-long immunity.
The CDC and most mainstream medical doctors recommend getting the measles vaccine. A growing number of medical doctors and natural health advocates do not recommend the measles vaccine due to questionable ingredients. As with all medications and vaccines, it is important to know the risks and benefits, and to be fully aware of the ingredients, especially if you have known allergies or religious beliefs (aborted fetal material is used in some vaccines).
How can I stay healthy?
Remember that the most significant factors in the state of your health are diet, exercise, and lifestyle. It is impossible for any vaccine or drug to make an unhealthy body healthy. Taking good care of yourself by eating natural and organic foods, getting proper exercise and rest, and reducing stress is the best way to strengthen your immune system and improve your overall health. Doing so will lessen your need for artificial immunity.",11,24,16.666666666666668,0,0.7054594703342604,0.46920850615192583,0.31688423906311847,0.325239895419641,0.2916666666666667,0.45188392095622565,0.39288048222939487,0.29076867857171845,0.2842944315168335,0.2687891891580962,0.20489211962171566,0.17764623489347287,0.14226061127633716,0.11995088219935343,0.9869312169633777,0.19781481956814195,0.10691234410243262,0.9001228061683332,0.178455185751104,0.17112504413679924,1.432927220608109,0.28345257735439316,0.16880955475702616,1.4235824661258103,0.28165023493475966,0.05208333333333333,0.02106782106782107,0.07142857142857142,0.048726467331118496,3.13153920730542,3.564661568783366,0,0,1.069250934811056,6.721289929845421,9.835593707123994,-0.5121734198857352,-0.3916270114947998,-1.1442891479396424,,0.6357012600201085,0.4038741520685914,0.7676008532588555,0.8872356887513647,0.3729377329767325,1.809098673897132,0.949938917024355,0.4903332670803377,-0.22238249902245372,1.5508221574059895,0.43611980125497246,0.775147241918176,-0.7785092183863895,0.5862244002887846,0.5573599672537023,0.5409385331607718,-0.7591747022386409,-0.8018686019662389,-0.8465793566619679,1.448462884767906,1.9634909798285662,1.3840564909307582,1.4998284983961643,1.9449289128406058,1.4910093117389156,0.738449604102787,-0.36349442017407774,1.0419435208087333,0.6365541508377037,-0.2771964474892052,0.02396499890383129,,,-1.610877305503425,0.5050229892020379,1.8427189207632497,0,3.054778761154099
159,yes_68.txt,"Michael Gerson: Public good vs. individual freedom
The measles outbreak at Californias Disneyland, along with several other smaller flare-ups, has health officials warning of worse to come. Preventable infectious disease is making its return to the developed world this time by invitation.
The scientific consensus on measles is effectively unanimous. Children with measles can get seriously ill, and there is chance of complications such as middle ear infections, pneumonia and encephalitis. Measles is highly transmissible one of the easiest viruses to get or give. The measles vaccine is effective one of the most successful against any virus or microbe.
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told me the evidence that measles vaccination is associated with such adverse events as autism and other afflictions has been completely discredited by independent scientific bodies.
Yet, a significant minority of parents many well-educated are opting out of vaccination.
Resistance to vaccination on the left often reflects an obsession with purity. Vaccines are placed in the same mental category as GMOs, DDT and gluten. But the problem with organic health care is the natural rate of child mortality is unacceptably high. Organically raised children can get some very nasty diseases.
Opposition to vaccination on the right often reflects an obsession with liberty in this case, freedom from intrusive state mandates. It has always struck me as odd that a parent would defend his or her children with a gun but leave them vulnerable to a microbe.
Whether hipsters or homeschoolers, parents who dont vaccinate are free riders. Their children benefit from herd immunity without assuming the very small risk of adverse reaction to vaccination. It is a game that works until too many play it.
Herd immunity requires about 90 percent vaccine coverage. Some children with highly vulnerable immune systems cant be vaccinated for medical reasons. When the number of non-medical exemptions from vaccination gets large enough, the child with leukemia becomes the most vulnerable to the spread of disease.
The government has the responsibility to keep vaccination rates above 90 percent, which benefits everyone. This requires burdening the freedom of parents in a variety of ways denying them some public good (like public education) and subjecting them to stigma (which they generally deserve). As the rate of vaccination goes lower, the level of coercion must increase making exemptions more difficult to secure.
This issue is important in itself. It also demonstrates a point that is properly called philosophic. Vaccination is communitarianism in its purest, laboratory form. The choices of citizens are restricted for a clearly defined social good.
Things get murkier with other kinds of goods. Does the same coercive power apply to chronic diseases involving lifestyle choices? Government has taken a position against the use of tobacco. What of substances such as sugar, salt and saturated fat?
Does the common good extend to the moral and social health of a community? Maybe just to the moral health of people under 21 or 18 who cant buy or consume certain things?
In all these matters, there is a balance between individual rights and the common good. This may sound commonplace. But some Americans seem to believe the mere assertion of a right is sufficient to end a public argument. It is not, when the exercise of that right has unacceptable public consequences, or when the sum of likely choices is dangerous to a community. Sometimes we need 90 percent of the public to make the right choice, or innocent people suffer.",14,39,16.76923076923077,0,0.5447686209686493,0.28045006684723905,0.3374226335214362,0.32826176004572993,0.0,0.4100674597971272,0.3771869711664095,0.3514916054666456,0.3920220525357031,0.24017844407966263,0.20333496824242692,0.1979880428314209,0.2401096892972225,0.12698273694637063,1.0978755229670398,0.21640249134246844,0.13833377643429656,1.1977725548817602,0.23715443275566256,0.1538309850176836,1.316896958021692,0.26316122426261396,0.15223656845924938,1.3048393237819726,0.25947635999761376,0.05,0.06666666666666667,0.08928571428571429,0.05388471177944862,3.042863054096576,3.48180589280793,0,0,1.131411539194558,6.8245769771638845,9.283999494381737,-0.20912837933500703,0.256414107705003,-1.123926917903901,,-0.7307787858040444,-1.0939784111624626,0.9535403048267901,0.9150664689306829,-0.7823310051255915,0.7144153169298199,0.4446100962500796,1.0643381151285067,1.497778920229829,0.6209198970210749,0.35702716106836946,1.121777414944361,1.720499088851271,0.7547691876070173,0.8829048786638389,0.8107523626460876,0.5513307985185534,0.7175347350573039,0.6366291760838322,-0.38367692825686495,-0.364544579076998,-0.3541622186146847,-0.7702872501225417,-0.6931635929924425,-0.8557317525624608,0.6693006455390477,1.1682049454876644,1.587068750616695,0.9197266935335701,-1.5343615995819833,-1.337383542158235,,,-0.33314353324375007,0.840206306259836,-0.08890813785184243,0,5.816848031084101
160,yes_69.txt,"Measles Outbreak: Pediatricians Refuse Unvaccinated Children To Combat Anti-Vaccine Movement And Safeguard Waiting Rooms
For Maryland resident Victoria Katona, choosing to vaccinate her children was a no-brainer. The issue also helped her picked her pediatrician, who first broached the topic while she was pregnant with her first child. During a prenatal interview, the doctor asked whether Katona planned to vaccinate her child because his office had a strict policy against treating unvaccinated children and those who delay vaccinations.
Thats important to me because I didnt want my newborn child in an office with someone who may have whooping cough or be shedding measles, said Katona, who now has two children ages 4 and 5. Why wouldnt you get them vaccinated? Its what you do -- to make sure your children are safe and not going to be sick.
In the wake of the worst measles outbreak the U.S. has seen in decades, some doctors are turning away unvaccinated children to protect individuals, such as cancer patients and young babies, who cannot receive live vaccines and depend on the health of others. Its a choice that every parent must make, and one that has launched a national conversation that could have dire social, medical and even legal consequences for parents and children alike.
Katona, who lives just outside Baltimore, said she would switch physicians if the office changed its policy on treating unvaccinated children, although shes confident this will not happen. If [my pediatrician] were willing to look past something that important, whats to say that she wouldnt circumvent other important medical issues, she said. Could I trust that she would be providing appropriate medical care to my children?
Most parents in her community immunize their children, and those who dont arent showing up at her pediatricians office, Katona said. I imagine those doctors that dont require vaccinations are well-known among the anti-vaxing groups. From my experience, nonvaxing parents ask around to see who they can go to without being pressured into vaccinating, she said.
In contrast, Karen Ernst takes her fully vaccinated children to a physician who strongly encourages immunization, but will still see patients who are skipping or delaying shots. The risk to my children is very low because theyve received all vaccinations. Im not necessarily worried about measles coming through the door, said Ernst, a mother of three in St. Paul, Minnesota.
Ernst said she might have felt otherwise had there been a measles outbreak when she was choosing a pediatrician. If I was doing it all over again and I was to have a new baby, I might be a little bit afraid to bring my child to an office that did see unvaccinated children, said Ernst, who helped relaunch Voices for Vaccines in 2013. Its a parent-led organization that advocates for on-time vaccination and the reduction of vaccine-preventable disease.
Pushback From Pediatricians
Experts said theres been a growing number of people in the last decade that have decided against immunization. As a result, some pediatricians across the country have become frustrated with parents who are opting out of childhood vaccinations.
There are a lot of pediatricians who are worried about this, said Arthur L. Caplan, who heads the division of medical ethics at New York University Langone Medical Center. Most pediatricians will still work with you even if you dont vaccinate. But the percent that wont is growing, and the measles outbreak is accelerating it.
The pediatricians who are now refusing unvaccinated patients are doing so out of mounting frustration, because measles is a vaccine-preventable disease, Caplan noted.
The ongoing measles outbreak is linked to Disney theme parks in California and has spread to 102 cases across 14 states since December. Its the largest number of cases the U.S. has seen since measles was declared eliminated in 2000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Dr. Mark Sawyer, an infectious-disease committee member at the American Academy of Pediatrics, said the vast majority of these cases are unvaccinated individuals. The general community of pediatricians is getting a little tired of these outbreaks linked to people intentionally not vaccinating their kids, he said. Clearly, this outbreak has smoldered along longer than others do, and that may drive some to say, You know what, Ive had enough of this, Im worried about my waiting room.
Sawyer said pediatricians will refuse unvaccinated patients for a number of reasons, including the risk they pose to other individuals in the waiting room, such as young children who are not yet eligible for immunization. Physicians will also turn away parents who are opposed to vaccinating because it suggests a lack of confidence in the doctors overall care. Pediatricians feel very strongly that vaccination is a very important preventative step that provides care, Sawyer said. They feel that parents who dont follow their recommendation are not letting them take good care of their patients, and thats a very difficult position for pediatricians to believe in.
But vaccines are not perfect, he said. One dose of the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine is 95 percent effective against the measles virus, while two doses are 99 percent effective. In other words, one in 20 single-dose vaccinated individuals are still susceptible to contracting measles during an outbreak, according to Sawyer, who is also a professor of pediatrics at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine and Rady Childrens Hospital.
There are also some adverse but extremely rare side effects from the MMR vaccine. One in six people has a fever within a week of getting a measles shot, about 5 percent of people experience a mild rash, and about 1 percent notice some swelling in their glands. Meanwhile, a severe allergy to the vaccine appears less than once in a million administered doses, according to the CDC.
Brain damage and coma suffered after the shot is so uncommon that its difficult to decipher whether immunization is the cause, while vaccines are usually administered around the same time a child is flagged for autism, according to ABC News. Scientific studies have also long disproved any link between autism and the MMR vaccine, experts have said.
According to the CDC, 69 people who received shots have died since 2004, but their deaths were not necessarily direct results of the vaccine because the agencys protocol for reporting adverse reactions merely correlates them, Newsweek reported.
Parents Against Vaccines
In 2014, all 50 states allowed a medical vaccine exemption; 48 states and the District of Columbia allowed a religious vaccine exemption; and 17 states allowed a philosophical, conscientious or personal belief exemption. Moreover, the exemptions are worded differently in each state. Families citing medical exemptions constitute a small number of those who dont vaccinate. In California, there were about 1,000 medical exemptions and more than 17,000 philosophical exemptions from immunization in the 2013-2014 school year, CNN reported.
Dr. Sydney Z. Spiesel, a clinical professor of pediatrics at the Yale School of Medicine, said the varying state laws on vaccine exemptions can make it difficult for pediatricians to enforce immunization. The number of licensed doctors who are against vaccinating is very small, but the business can be lucrative, he said. The pediatricians [against vaccines] are doing it because it attracts attention or money, said Spiesel, who runs a private practice in Woodbridge, Connecticut. I think the great majority of pediatricians everywhere are strong believers in immunization.
Spiesel said the anti-vaccine movement in the U.S. has dramatically waned, due to pushback from pediatricians amid the ongoing measles outbreak. Parents who were once vaccine-hesitant are now lining up to have their children immunized. Now, suddenly, theyre beginning to understand there really is a risk. There really is measles out there, and measles is a potentially lethal disease, he said.
The Anti-Vaccine Movement
Some parents who are hesitant about vaccines have been drawn into an anti-vaccine movement that often cites debunked research. In 1998, a prominent British medical journal published research by Andrew Wakefield, who suggested the combined MMR vaccine could cause autism. However, this article was retracted by the publication in 2010, after years of reassessment determined Wakefield had been dishonest and misleading, while violating basic rules of research ethics, according to the New York Times. Wakefield was subsequently stripped of his medical license in the U.K., CNN reported at the time.
Anti-vaccine groups have also expressed concern over thimerosal, a vaccine preservative containing mercury. However, thimerosal was removed from the final product of nearly all vaccines -- including the MMR vaccine -- in the U.S. by 2002, due to mounting public pressure rather than sound science, as a wealth of scientific studies have shown thimerosal-containing vaccines do not cause neurodevelopment disorders, according to experts.
The MMR vaccine, developed by John Enders in the late 1950s and universally distributed by the late 1960s, is most effective against the measles virus when delivered in two doses. However, some vaccine-hesitant parents believe spacing out immunization shots is best for their childrens health.
Dr. James Cherry, a professor of pediatrics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles, recommended against this. The idea that multiple vaccines together overload the immune system, or to start them later and space them out -- that whole idea is just ridiculous, he said.
Cherry, who is also an attending physician at the Mattel Childrens Hospital UCLA, said five decades of vaccinations are responsible for the consistently low number of measles-related deaths in the U.S. Tremendous public-health efforts to encourage immunization and quarantine infected individuals have curbed the current outbreak, he added. If we were to not have a vaccine today, wed have about 3,000 deaths per year, Cherry said.

161,yes_7.txt,"Vaccinations do work
As I dont have children yet, Ill probably get a bit of flack for writing this, and thats OK, but I honestly dont understand the culture around the anti-vaccination movement.
Measles isnt a disease a person typically hears about these days, but it came roaring back when an outbreak in California was reported in late December.
According to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this year, as of Feb. 6, 121 cases have been documented in 17 states, including our neighbors South Dakota, Utah and Nebraska. In fact, 2014 saw the highest number of measles infections since 2000, with 644 cases reported in 27 states. In 2013, just under 200 cases were reported and the year before that, just more than 50.
While measles is the current headline grabber du jour, other life threatening diseases could just as easily strike at unvaccinated populations.
Which brings me to wonder why people dont believe in vaccinating their children.
It just doesnt make much sense. The tired argument of vaccinations being a cause for autism has been disproven and, in my mind at least, vaccines safeguarding against deadly diseases outweighs whatever minute risks, both real and imagined, come with a vaccine. Whats more, it seems a strange world to live in when a former Playboy playmates impassioned crusade against vaccination has as much validity in the public consciousness as collected volumes of medical information.
The infinitely idiotic Glenn Beck even proposed the outbreak is a hoax to increase government control. Im sure more than a few people believed him because he is a voice of authority because of his ability to speak endlessly into a microphone.
I realize there are some people who cannot be vaccinated. I remember reading about one child who is recovering from leukemia who is unable to receive vaccination shots because of his compromised immune system.
His father requested his local school board to require all students in the district to have their vaccinations as unvaccinated children pose a serious health risk to his son. While I disagree with them, I do respect religious objections to vaccination, especially if its part of a strict religious lifestyle for the person.
However, declining to vaccinate children on the grounds that it isnt natural or that its poison, is complete poppycock. Younger generations havent had to see their friends or family die from a disease like polio or small pox and I think that may have something to do with decreased rates of vaccination.
More importantly, people against vaccinations not only endanger themselves and others by not protecting themselves against preventable diseases, they erode progress that decades of scientific inquiry have brought.
Such decisions take us back to a time when the medicine man would try to cure illness by burning grass and offerings to a supernatural plane of existence. They cause people to trust the modern equivalent of snake oil salesmen and their wondrous potions to instantly relieve and cure all sorts of disease and conditions.

That's one of the worst performances since the government started tracking how well vaccines work a decade ago. The best flu vaccines were 50 to 60 percent effective.
But this year, the vaccine doesn't include the specific virus that is making most people sick. Early in the season, officials warned the vaccine probably would not work very well.

163,yes_74.txt,"Mathis, Boychuk: RedBlueAmerica: Should Americans be required to get vaccinated?
Suddenly, the debate over vaccines has gone mainstream.
Amid a measles breakout a disease that doctors believed had been eradicated a decade ago a pair of Republican politicians came under fire for seemingly anti-vaccination comments. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said vaccinations should largely be left to parents, while Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said he believed that vaccinations can lead to mental disorders in children.
The idea that vaccines cause autism has been debunked, but the declining vaccination rate is making the measles resurgence possible. What rules should Americans follow to protect public health? Joel Mathis and Ben Boychuk debate.
JOEL MATHIS
Heres a proposal: Lets treat unvaccinated people as we treat smokers. Smoking is still a legal choice in America we dont have it in our hearts to prohibit tobacco use entirely, for some reason but its been almost completely driven from the public square thanks to a mixture of both culture and the law.
The same should happen to people who dont have their measles shots.
They shouldnt be allowed on planes. Or in classrooms. Or in grocery stores. Or in any of a thousand other places where the public gathers and can be exposed to somebody elses misinformed decision to risk their lives to a deadly but easily defeated with vaccinations! infectious disease.
It worked with tobacco. The Centers for Disease Control reported this week that nonsmokers exposure to secondhand smoke dropped from 53 percent in 2000 to 25 percent in 2012. Howd it happen? During those dozen years, 700 towns and cities (as well as 26 states and Washington) have banned smoking in public places. It seemed a radical step at the time. Now its widely accepted as a legal act to protect public health.
Well, folks: The measles virus can do damage to a human body a lot more quickly than a couple of puffs of smoke.
If were not willing to permanently exile anti-vaxxers from the public square, we should at least make emergency provisions to do so. Anti-vaxxers should be made to understand that when there is a public health emergency such as a measles outbreak they'll be quarantined for the duration. They get to make their choices, but they dont get to forfeit responsibility to the communities they live in.
Its fitting the issue was raised by GOP presidential candidates. For 30 years, the GOP has been happy to subvert science particularly regarding evolution and climate when it proved incompatible or inconvenient. It turns out viruses are pretty inconvenient, too.
BEN BOYCHUK
This one should be easy. Vaccinations protect individuals and whole communities from debilitating or deadly diseases. People who refuse to vaccinate their kids for fear of them developing autism or suffering some other remote harm would put their childrens lives and the lives of other children in jeopardy for a folly.
But its a free country, more or less. And its a divided country, as the coverage of presidential candidates trying to pander to everyone on the vaccination question certainly shows.
Would-be Republican presidential candidates find themselves in an impossible position. No political candidate can truly speak his mind anymore, if he ever could. A question as seemingly straightforward as whether parents should immunize their kids against preventable illnesses ends up being an clumsy exercise of on-the-one-hand, and-on-the-other 
At the same time, no Republican presidential candidate worthy of serious consideration would endorse the outlandish idea of jailing parents for refusing to vaccinate their kids, as a USA Today columnist argued last month. No Democrat would take that position, either. The idea should be offensive to Americans who at least profess to value individual liberty, regardless of party.
But what about mandatory vaccinations with penalties and consequences short of jail? Thats a policy debate worth having.
Mandatory vaccinations arent unheard of in the United States. Massachusetts in 1809 passed the nations first law requiring every citizen to be vaccinated for small pox. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the laws constitutionality in 1905.
What if instead of the government applying direct pressure on people to vaccinate, the law made life too inconvenient for people not to vaccinate?
For example, lawmakers could tweak public accommodation laws to let businesses discriminate on the basis of vaccination. Disneyland, where the current measles outbreak began in December, might require visitors to produce vaccination records as a condition of entry. Other businesses that attract large crowds might follow suit.
It would be inconvenient, of course. Anti-vax parents would howl with indignation. But personal choices often have broad consequences. And their indignation should not trump the public health.",22,54,16.314814814814813,0,0.49647040809241105,0.24971437261821078,0.2234403925355185,0.2094456987003937,0.05555555555555555,0.3949106479118956,0.3659128850145861,0.36314924030027923,0.31420654092031314,0.20333987604457848,0.1821798266798845,0.15454708737815964,0.1575476537617851,0.1046704059893948,0.9087842778976682,0.179903748818609,0.1104172730460582,0.9231308027929616,0.18541856550630073,0.14508336940161237,1.2651429780648136,0.24883699875986925,0.15018414141765637,1.2808422462525662,0.25564435272488173,0.02395833333333333,0.0338023088023088,0.043478260869565216,0.03810191678354371,3.1126798517143706,3.53061173573099,0,0,1.1268616904090878,6.556833983523091,9.320319616542207,0.598991728800268,0.9044552269048057,-1.2141429093122558,,-1.1414962871732972,-1.3378749942939,-0.0783707055697661,-0.1792061389571828,-0.562279816915625,0.31763593255483863,0.08158612809258428,1.1745360132446454,0.2552448362670397,-0.5764018641304789,-0.7175093431905075,0.38153122094231007,-0.3880870811836728,0.2199704451681599,0.3280526754105321,0.2809460689195625,-0.6129933120374533,-0.684420403199761,-0.6706291563322249,-1.3104029634145893,-1.4029383822864336,-1.5812187217468587,-1.0514222770929649,-1.2263018369586407,-1.2612868867513467,-0.1950613365076983,0.06426655773620295,0.1887040306745328,0.05329738127311291,-0.5445662395025658,-0.5354859983097008,,,-0.4266673255158369,-0.028663383187309634,0.03828125086306748,0,3.443865118818326
164,yes_77.txt,"CDC: current US flu season at threshold for 'epidemic' status
Following warning from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in December that this flu season is set to be a particularly harsh one, the organizations latest influenza surveillance report states that this years flu season has now crossed the epidemic threshold.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a statement on December 4thTrusted Source urging anyone still unvaccinated to seek immediate vaccination. The CDC also recommended that people at high risk of complications who develop flu should receive prompt treatment with antiviral drugs.
The basis for the CDCs concern was the predominance of the more severe strains of flu this season seasonal influenza A H3N2 viruses which are usually responsible for the flu-related illnesses that cause hospitalizations and deaths.
For example, reads the CDC statement, H3N2 viruses were predominant during the 2012-2013, 2007-2008 and 2003-2004 seasons, the three seasons with the highest mortality levels in the past decade. All were characterized as moderately severe.'
In addition, approximately half of the H3N2 viruses analyzed in this season are what are known as drift variants viruses with antigenic or genetic changes that may make the virus less responsive to vaccination.
In the 2007-2008 flu season, a drift variant of H3N2 was the predominant strain, which resulted in a vaccine efficacy of 37% against that strain and 42% against H3N2 viruses overall.
However, in the organizations latest influenza surveillance reportTrusted Source, it is noted that 15 children have died across the country from flu, and there has been an increase in the number of states reporting a high level of flu activity from 13 to 22 in just 1 week.
The report also states that during October-December 2014, there have been 2,643 laboratory-confirmed flu-related hospitalizations an overall rate of 9.7 hospitalizations per 100,000 population.
Seniors have been most hard hit by the current flu season, with 38.3 hospitalizations per 100,000 population of the over-65s.
The majority of hospitalized adults 96% had at least one reported underlying medical condition, the report says. Most commonly, these underlying conditions were metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease and obesity.
How worried should we be about a flu epidemic?
Although the word epidemic sounds alarming, it is not uncommon for a harsh flu season to be described as such. The CDC consider a flu season to reach epidemic level when a threshold of deaths attributable to pneumonia and influenza has passed. The surveillance report confirms that the current proportion of deaths is right on that threshold, which is 6.8%.
Speaking to The Washington Post, Erin Burns, a health communications specialist within the CDCs Influenza division, said of the report:
It is a bit early to make any kind of characterization about pediatric deaths this season, but from looking at the curve going back to 2011-2012, it doesnt seem like anything unusual is happening.
However, Burns acknowledged that pediatric death data typically lag behind other measures used to calculate the severity of a flu season.
Each year, a committee of experts pick which viruses should be included in the flu vaccine many months in advance, in order to maximize the vaccines effectiveness. However, there always remains the possibility that the viruses will drift during that time.
Some critics have commented that this drift is the most concerning aspect of the current epidemic.
For instance, the head of the Johns Hopkins Medicine Office of Epidemiology and Infection Prevention, Trish Perl, is quoted by The Post as saying the most concerning thing about the flu season this year is there is a mismatch between the predominant strain that is circulating and what was put in the vaccine.
The CDCs position is that vaccination remains vital, and that it is not too late to get vaccinated.
While the vaccines ability to protect against drifted H3N2 viruses this season may be reduced, we are still strongly recommending vaccination, says Dr. Joseph Brezee, chief of the Influenza Epidemiology and Prevention Branch at the CDC, in a statement.
Vaccination has been found to provide some protection against drifted viruses in past seasons, Dr. Brezee reassures. Also, vaccination will offer protection against other flu viruses that may become more common later in the season.",22,29,27.344827586206897,0,0.7601388948304313,0.5103731995742089,0.10739237815141678,0.10376762869683179,0.06896551724137931,0.31617699760411466,0.3236941373951769,0.1111732947230699,0.22192464417806176,0.19768683410116605,0.1807026103131428,0.04791231477039232,0.14294875679311878,0.04523743542375662,0.39263711068693197,0.077906593272128,0.1208209591100579,1.035937151104558,0.20905428544765042,0.15221374200691082,1.316432775405961,0.2631350727022518,0.15323411824811634,1.319079834744456,0.2635882411396688,0.010265700483091788,0.013636363636363636,0.014492753623188406,0.02525879917184265,3.112317792828137,3.511718850101205,0,0,1.1423453739243212,6.758869028555367,9.466547344287388,0.598991728800268,-0.17561330509486553,0.9756647498331886,,1.1006831976111122,0.7305278465169766,-1.1289837023120177,-1.152480424857363,-0.5091640128649435,-1.7434762284501877,-1.2778515314252943,-1.2073553373338912,-1.2182840226282923,-0.7601362082315853,-0.7925418314421181,-1.435555529281272,-0.760934383775699,-1.2045637274020802,-1.1864827692355924,-1.199618224916137,-0.17908286292032385,-0.10858137493604228,-0.0734034118200774,-0.5550083251813596,-0.37385795656283055,-0.3564024404125971,-0.6336460048484673,-0.3767850257099837,-0.420556558558729,-0.6495403612708278,-0.6131226395778111,-0.6961369220572307,-0.6517522352538428,-0.549699161920913,-0.8459029007822004,,,-0.10839459405499245,0.6269732945370853,0.5503559411107265,0,-3.6748271032694366
165,yes_78.txt,"BILL CRAWFORD: Keep schools free from preventable diseases
Health science saves lives, particularly in Mississippi.
Since scientific research by Dr. Jonas Salk produced the polio vaccine in the mid-1950s, vaccines developed by health scientists have brought seven major human diseases under some control smallpox, diphtheria, tetanus, yellow fever, whooping cough, polio, and measles. Unfortunately, hepatitis B is not yet one of them.
Mississippi can stand proud.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that for 2013-14, Mississippi had the largest percentage of kindergartners in public and private schools who have been vaccinated against diseases, the Associated Press reported.
Mississippis success results primarily from a law that prohibits children from entering school until they get vaccinations prescribed by the state health officer. The state adopted this law to protect citizens, especially children, from vaccine preventable diseases polio, hepatitis B, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, and chicken pox.
Comes now a group calling itself Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights wanting Mississippi to stand down when it comes to vaccinations. They want the law changed to allow for conscientious objections so their children can attend school without vaccinations.
Bless their hearts. They must not understand the awful history of contagious diseases before vaccinations.
But, are they so blind they cannot see that health science is a gift from God to ease pain, suffering, and needless death?
In 1952, prior to Salk vaccine availability, a polio epidemic in the U.S. left 3,145 dead and 21,269 paralyzed mostly children. With the vaccine, polio had been virtually wiped out in America. It has now seen resurgence in areas allowed to refuse vaccines.
How many children, besides theirs, are they willing to put at risk?
In 2010, ten infants in California died from a whooping cough epidemic. Health officials researched the cause of the outbreak and found vaccine refusal among family members to be a key factor in the deaths.
Almost 100,000 new Americans get infected with hepatitis B each year. About 5,000 die from the disease and its complications. In areas of the world where vaccination rates are low, deaths are in the hundreds of thousands.
Do they know it just takes one?
In 2005, according to the New England Journal of Medicine, one unvaccinated 17-year-old girl returned to Indiana from a church mission Romania where she unknowingly contracted the measles. That led to the largest documented measles epidemic in the U.S. since 1996. A similar measles epidemic recently started at Disneyland.
Surely no responsible leader would willingly open school doors to contagious disease. We have enough issues for our health scientists to deal with as it is. And this is one we have under control.
Pray most legislators and our governor understand that public safety is a proper function of state government, and that includes keeping our schools free from preventable diseases.",17,30,18.033333333333335,0,0.6691439079827276,0.4370920169970085,0.27622220358427835,0.2748368779818217,0.1,0.42366701080887154,0.382317010902077,0.2547024965645713,0.3566696073411443,0.24206756990064274,0.19861981513571333,0.12639348112177431,0.1777531350485417,0.08094391275345039,0.7041663892994817,0.1383826623422798,0.11863973701935362,1.0208562364848457,0.2028240964363439,0.15162653154028566,1.3092985430477018,0.2594457762755297,0.15258797297798493,1.3145378618149777,0.2614746839079476,0.002631578947368421,0.02679738562091503,0.07272727272727272,0.03116883116883117,3.2208170114939163,3.6150639594261462,0,0,1.140456932260211,7.147103975339523,9.596313193568802,0.09391666121572108,-0.13241056381487867,-0.8729624327133887,,0.3268816134617379,0.14902056364161384,0.39947682136747914,0.42303378950817794,-0.3862388663476518,1.0704282779057228,0.6097966449927857,0.14940498214255082,0.9332819813318745,0.682319988709183,0.11752963176304,-0.098214209637463,0.1279491105580857,-0.3487240031857448,-0.2723595027000511,-0.32176326889234147,-0.27005591335451107,-0.18556444681029208,-0.23082739890242188,-0.617217646146363,-0.5169994633154542,-0.6724387365128061,-0.7221529599138283,-0.4776931245731338,-0.6442419343214583,-0.9029283070680858,-0.1710340568416735,1.0815889920674941,-0.32730875360710765,0.9884983331223046,0.8520943957110172,,,-0.14721219750507056,1.8868590269624053,1.0047828005043224,0,-1.4099064498464633
166,yes_80.txt,"State bracing for measles outbreak
State health officials are preparing for a possible measles outbreak on the heels of a national outbreak.
Figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that about 88 percent of Louisiana children younger than age 3 have received the measles vaccine. Michigan and Oregon are the only other states under 90 percent.
Over 120 people from 17 states, including one in Texas, have been infected in recent weeks.
Dr. Frank Welch, state immunization medical director, recommends vaccinating children against measles at ages 1 and 2
Welch said the state conducted six rash illness investigations since a Houston outbreak of measles two years ago and came up with no cases in Louisiana.
Thats right on the other side of our border, Welch said. Were lucky we havent had a case yet.
According to the state immunization schedule, 14 vaccines should be administered from birth until age 16.
The law also requires that children entering primary school be protected against a range of high-risk diseases including measles, tetanus, polio and pneumonia.
Students dont have to get immunized if their parents have medical, religious or personal concerns.
Up to 95 percent of primary school children are vaccinated on schedule, but Welch said there is a critical lack of attention to 1- and 2-year-olds.
Where we fall behind is the period before children enter school, he said. Our outreach efforts are focused on getting these children vaccinated on time.",12,15,18.333333333333332,0,0.7361212633550167,0.5189355044137864,0.08412627689540386,0.08412627689540386,0.0,0.31571410440148845,0.28717469125835887,0.03113178450062319,0.19658208234856528,0.19377946276818553,0.17786963462769503,0.023994609644567524,0.14134384106016823,0.012517426026348803,0.10973776953271984,0.02142435055169575,0.10638532229070218,0.9393630214018186,0.18653393946807542,0.16268343631103266,1.3183176382071424,0.2667793048972434,0.15697480324655533,1.3006922371874137,0.2607080896258245,0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.05291005291005291,3.2365102206433134,3.6107119905661653,0,0,1.1100658577533578,6.992395847208347,9.30490178959981,-0.4111584063688258,-0.7804516830146815,-0.8134029098588458,,0.8964424814242218,0.7984722006786739,-1.3396177962499243,-1.333373420424037,-0.7823310051255915,-1.7555939799509734,-2.4537724950377116,-1.9639758966867331,-1.622946231928167,-0.887133020958447,-0.9364376205906734,-1.8431200039555042,-0.8019229942989762,-1.9888215403604543,-2.016596943378013,-2.0194998320019777,-0.7811553992354289,-0.6015603059606449,-0.6424459638429203,0.5541554421367438,-0.33603999832507764,-0.04422648277137918,-0.12125869138383398,-0.785298581592182,-0.725373368796325,-0.9902743599907043,-1.0711783043089333,-0.00792729215474801,0.8662207705257509,1.2109815482056352,0.7805899829048386,,,-0.7719117585500815,1.3848059146982432,-0.01571041732162751,0,-7.179567542097535
167,yes_81.txt,"The danger in the anti-vaccine movement
About three years ago, my sister-in-law shared the good news that she was pregnant with her first child I was going to be Auntie Em! My partner and I celebrated the impending arrival of a new family member by immediately going to our doctor to get booster shots for whooping cough. The last thing either of us wanted was to even risk the possibility of being delivery vectors for a serious illness to our newborn niece.
It seemed like a no-brainer, frankly: Vaccines for things such as whooping cough, measles, mumps and polio have a long and well-researched track record of being incredibly effective. They've saved millions of lives and countless dollars in public health money.
And so it is utterly baffling to me to witness the emergence of the modern and seemingly rather large anti-vaccine movement, especially since the few sketchy studies purporting to show links between vaccines and things like autism have been so thoroughly debunked and renounced even by the scientists behind them.
I have many friends with small children enrolled in various day care centers and schools, and they are now terrified that kids who haven't been immunized likely are sharing their classrooms. Rightly so, too, as I recently learned that a disturbingly high number of parents in Wisconsin have applied for and gotten nonmedical exemptions for their children. They're astoundingly easy to obtain, since our state merely requires a parental signature nothing from a medical professional for the opt-out.
This is a travesty, not to mention an entirely avoidable public health disaster waiting to happen or, as is the case with the recent outbreak at Disneyland, already happening.
It's not just kids who benefit from immunization. I have several friends who are immunocompromised due to disease or organ transplant and so they can't get vaccinated. They rely on the rest of society something you'll hear referred to as ""herd immunity"" to help ensure that they don't catch one of these highly contagious and often deadly diseases.
I suspect that this anti-vaccine movement is the product of both poor public health education and our remove from the days when it was quite common to have direct experience with these illnesses. Apparently it doesn't take long about 50 years, by my count for the collective consciousness to forget just how serious these threats were to our very survival as a society. But I know people who had polio as children, and I've seen the serious ill-effects it has on their life even now, as longtime survivors.
It shouldn't take seeing your child fall ill or even die to make you appreciate just how important getting them immunized is. And if you doubt, say, the measles vaccine's efficacy alone, get this: According to the World Health Organization, measles vaccination resulted in a 75% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2013 worldwide. That's huge.
Lest you think that it's no big deal that a few kids don't get vaccinated, let's go back to the concept of herd immunity. Put simply, if the vast majority of people in a given area are vaccinated against a disease leaving only those with medical reasons preventing them from being vaccinated (newborns, immunocompromised adults) even if one person does still come down with the disease, everyone else acts as a sort of firebreak to prevent it from spreading. The fewer people who are inoculated, though, the more and more likely it becomes that the disease will spread like wildfire through the population, putting the unvaccinated people at particular risk, but everyone else, too.
Wisconsin currently lags the nation when it comes to official policy on this issue. It is far too easy to obtain nonmedical exemptions for vaccination, and that needs to change. We also could use a comprehensive public health campaign to better inform people of the facts about vaccines and good hygiene in general. The investment we make in these efforts would be minuscule when compared to the cost of inaction.
The science is in. We have decades of research and experience to back up the fact that vaccines are, by and large, incredibly safe and effective ways of keeping more of us healthy and alive than ever before in human history. I don't know about you, but I think that's something worth celebrating and continuing.",12,30,27.466666666666665,0,0.5225237231573154,0.3397059574175958,0.27685811065344346,0.2622606495602263,0.03333333333333333,0.37414455704990474,0.3653139548272256,0.3520338628454847,0.37008124722518987,0.24751174144832225,0.21624635397203562,0.2041823407846955,0.22716217430882318,0.14287139350495656,1.1915232871194086,0.23840067650035818,0.15581388963407125,1.291665236987656,0.25884447118869974,0.16647613994614693,1.3948501788817598,0.27899994963733404,0.16583632043499416,1.3919939118291536,0.27807616610242086,0.05721491228070175,0.05708146629199261,0.03488372093023256,0.048650093557872226,3.0967628463488275,3.5486799430285987,0,0,1.1157117325257682,6.298713995286374,9.076727941346814,-0.4111584063688258,-0.13241056381487867,0.9998536748239224,,-0.9199445603368805,-0.6237658585248551,0.40523385422263725,0.30720919377196465,-0.6503002921996116,-0.22598477148807894,0.06230066137387019,1.0694639939400161,1.147434909608267,0.8592656576958501,1.0128372508290897,1.227330007804792,1.3898271176019574,1.1356004670891837,1.15769638606877,1.1300723211239068,1.2803804567332993,1.1968257646329434,1.184691574175016,0.9559560420442557,1.1995117804291762,1.0026309265819522,1.0925641745617432,1.2431323567177568,1.1127527319005204,0.9087744073018933,0.846230888012827,-0.07366160065872264,0.6323614539265627,-0.7702222219413583,-0.23861885728849888,,,-0.6558587545260036,-0.8663048503631885,-0.8147521207554697,0,2.800939729078006

According to a DHHS news release, the vaccination is offered by appointment only, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 8:30-11 a.m. and Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:15-4 p.m. To make an appointment or to speak with a nurse, call 707-268-2108.
Unlike most cancers, the release states, cervical cancer is preventable, and when HPV vaccines are administered to both male and female preteens, chances of women acquiring the sexually transmitted disease are significantly decreased.
Most cervical cancers are the result of becoming infected with HPV, the release states. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. The disease often takes years, even decades to cause cervical cancer after a person gets infected.
Wardrip said that HPV numbers arent reported locally, but each year nationally, about 17,500 women and 9,300 men are affected by cancers caused by HPV.
Just like all other vaccines, the HPV vaccine must be given before possible exposure to the disease to be effective in preventing illness, Wardrip said.
Clinical trials have shown that the vaccines provide close to 100 percent protection against precancers and for genital warts, according to the release, which goes on to state that since the vaccine was first recommended in 2006, there has been a 56 percent reduction in HPV infections among teen girls in the US.
Tia Baratelle, public affairs office for Planned Parenthood Northern California, agreed with the DHHS recommendation.
We definitely encourage people to look into HPV vaccinations, especially under the age of 26, she said. Its one way to protect yourself against cervical cancer, and I think education is getting better and the word is getting out. But theres still more work to be done.",11,17,27.11764705882353,0,0.7091718069277704,0.48847457203887373,0.1740799800238826,0.16179308972575449,0.9411764705882353,0.3156976365856826,0.32473138404197477,0.14697938518455395,0.31052377957771404,0.23152888301759958,0.19640705685441692,0.12454234281889139,0.22003032674510328,0.07086222333845679,0.6149071790306679,0.12172903398598643,0.1385561337369119,1.1979954957897019,0.23874297950569517,0.16014373923301864,1.3666560112799564,0.2762807290281341,0.16135130206340126,1.3607106348194133,0.27450522058448085,0.007692307692307693,0.02056277056277056,0.04081632653061224,0.053061224489795916,3.187928420086873,3.588319487823713,0,0,1.1845552666163353,6.241789027039845,9.135509074177312,-0.5121734198857352,-0.6940462004547078,0.9305622037905321,,0.667270163280258,0.5567559319691034,-0.5252434175632599,-0.6180773160094254,2.9455950069020758,-1.7560250791733505,-1.2444523371484504,-0.8688856593141356,0.19643963925314603,0.3397931259111299,0.005136644870241468,-0.12975813101264608,1.2076838959368073,-0.5903695233778894,-0.5342736355311725,-0.5635030250162402,0.5606047382019272,0.7186727745179448,0.6767684660159672,0.2850988778216042,0.6338229397109506,0.7696942605590338,0.4782204072520106,0.5481180846655413,0.734826703676451,-0.7349551283707425,-0.38045944479374905,0.10744312685222793,0.8745196483800249,0.5222355384228489,0.41267311323614414,,,0.7592450621378836,-1.051035658103791,-0.6089065478895815,0,-1.5614551175119833
169,yes_83.txt,"READ: Vaccinations generate more debate now than in past years
With new grandbabies showing up in my household, you would never think that the granddaddy would be the one getting the vaccinations, but that is something that happens at my house.
With my last granddaughter, I found out from my daughter-in-law that I should get a DPT shot, or a pertussis shot, if I was going to be around my new sweet little grandchild. In other words, I was told that if I was going to see her closer than the screen door out back, I was getting a shot, which I did.
Many of you may think these shots are just for children and really old folks, but right now pertussis, better known as whooping cough, is making somewhat of a comeback in our state and many thought it had gone away. So far this year 238 cases have been reported, compared to 179 last year, and out in California there is somewhat of an epidemic with over 9,000 cases.
Whooping cough is a contagious infection and not something you get over with a pill. Vaccination is the best form of preventing the infection, and the newer vaccines developed after 2000 are safe, but it is reported that they don't last as long and you may have to have a booster, especially if you are going to be around small children.
I was glad to get my DPT shot and having grown up in a time back in the '50s and '60s when vaccinations were just something everyone did, it wasn't all that big of a deal to do for my grandkids. But recently while eating lunch at a local sandwich place, where if you eat their sandwiches you are suppose to get skinny, I overheard a group of homeroom mothers discussing their children's school vaccinations at a table behind me.
Realizing that my sandwich wasn't making me skinny, I decided to listen in on the ladies' conversation about needles and shots, which was a lot more interesting than reading the nutrient content of my Cheetos bag, which had become empty.
Stories about kids hiding under tables and doctors getting bit seemed to be very funny to that group, but having been a kid myself over 50 years ago and experiencing some of those same traumatic events, I was glad I had finished my weight-reducing sandwich as I remembered back to the days when the health department nurse would show up at my school.
Those ladies were even talking about the option of vaccinating your child or not. Back when I was going to school there were no options. We all got stuck whether we wanted to or not.
Plus, so many times we got stuck while standing in a line with a bunch of other kids who also didn't want to get stuck, but had to. We didn't have our mothers close by or even the option of a nice doctor's office with pull-out white paper to sit on.
And I think because we stood in those lines and had those health department people in white coats show up at our schools to give us those vaccinations we didn't like that a lot of the infections past generations once endured no longer cause our children problems today.
I know the Internet gives out numerous side effects that can happen with vaccinations and the dangers that may evolve from taking certain medicine. I remember back when I went for cancer surgery, I made the mistake of checking out the procedure on the Internet and almost died before turning my computer off without leaving the house. Sure, there are risks to everything we do, but where would we be if everything we did was 100 percent a sure thing.
I remember the days of standing in line for the polio shots, and later, how excited I was when we no longer had to take shots because it was given to us on a sugar cube. As I grew up, I knew individuals who had to wear braces and use crutches because of polio.
In our classrooms each year we took up dimes for the March of Dimes and placed them in cutouts in a small card to go into a fund to pay for research to find a cure. Because of our dimes and many more, a cure was found and today those braces and crutches are no longer seen.
As I listened to those ladies discuss the options of not getting inoculations and the many fears they expressed about all the side effects from taking the injections, I wondered what our parents really thought about it those many years ago when they sent us to school to meet the health nurse.
I think they were more concerned with the dangers of the diseases, which they knew of first-hand, than the rare chances of the side effects, which they knew very little about.

170,yes_84.txt,"On measles
The latest victims of the California measles outbreak are college students.
As of Feb. 3, students at three different public colleges were believed to have contracted measles. The outbreak of measles this year has been the most serious in years, pushing policy makers to reconsider how to contain and quell this disease that has been virtually eradicated since 2000, when effective and widespread vaccination immunized the majority of the public.
Making vaccine injection compulsory has become a hot topic among legislators, with politicians like N.J. Gov. and ex-officio University trustee Chris Christie drawing criticism for supporting parents choice to vaccinate. Given that 22 states do not require measles immunizations for college students, some universities are wondering if it is time for a policy change.
Following the current outbreak, California schools have plans to make the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine a required immunization for incoming students by 2017. University policy currently mandates the MMR vaccine in accordance with New Jersey law, which allows for religious-based exemptions from vaccination.
Given the present incidence of measles, is the loophole in New Jersey law that allows parents and citizens to withhold from vaccination for non-medical reasons a point of potential concern?
This debate highlights the tension between private liberty and public good; in an institution with diverse citizens of various beliefs and backgrounds, we are reminded constantly to respect and tolerate other views, to learn to coexist. But what happens when these opinions threaten our personal health? Do we still remain devoted to freedom of opinion and religion, even when these doctrines endanger others?
As students at a private institution, our schools greatest priority should be geared toward personal health. As university students we have the right to safety, the right to know that coexisting will not physically harm us.
For those who subscribe to the scientific evidence in favor of vaccine safety, mandating vaccination might seem like a no-brainer. Unvaccinated individuals threaten the health of larger communities, including those who cannot be vaccinated because they are too young, necessitate medical exemptions or have not maintained a sufficient immune response to deem them insusceptible to disease.
That said, mandating all community members to vaccinate, including those with deep religious or philosophical qualms, may be counterintuitive when trying to increase overall community vaccination rates. Instead of increasing vaccination, mandates can serve to outrage, animate and propel the anti-vaccine community. While allowing non-medical exemptions to vaccination pose serious threats to communities, enforcing compulsory vaccination may be even more destructive to public health. Compulsory vaccination laws have historically galvanized anti-vaccination movements, while efforts to educate the public on the benefits of vaccination while allowing non-medical exemptions proved more successful.
However, it still remains crucial that non-medical exemptions are extremely restricted.
Research has shown that states with loose exemption policies typically have more parents filing for non-medical exemptions and a higher incidence of vaccine-preventable disease. Obtaining non-medical exemptions must be harder than just signing a form. Effective policies should require citizens to thoroughly consider the consequences of not vaccinating, mandating multiple discussions with physicians and requiring a thorough, written explanation of reasons for avoiding vaccination. Additionally, exemptions ought to only be granted for a particular amount of time, and parents asked to reexamine their decision at regular and frequent intervals.
Although the measles remains a particularly urgent and prevalent concern to a community across the country and may not currently threaten the health of University students, New Jersey and University policy on vaccination still necessitates conversation and review.
Although vaccination is one of the most successful breakthroughs in the field of health, saving countless lives and reducing incidence of disease, the anti-vaccine movement has consistently grown in following thanks to the propagation of misinformation about vaccine safety and growing apathy towards vaccination. Because vaccines have become so effective, the consequences of disease are less tangible. In this sense, vaccines are a victim of their own success.
This is a crisis we must address as future lawmakers, citizens and parents, balancing principles of autonomy and government tolerance of various religious and philosophical beliefs; allowing room for private liberty while still ultimately emphasizing public health.

171,yes_85.txt,"Doctors Want To Remind Americans That The HPV Vaccine Isnt All About Sex
Dr. Ronald A. DePinho is on a mission.
DePinho, whos been a cancer researcher for decades and currently serves as the president of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, wants to reframe the national conversation about the HPV vaccine to drive home a fundamental point.
Its important to appreciate that this is a cancer vaccine. A cancer vaccine! DePinho said in an interview with ThinkProgress. Its a dream come true that weve converted knowledge into something that can actually save lives and avoid getting cancer in the first place. Its really what we have been hoping for, and now we have it.
Since the introduction of the HPV vaccine in 2006, the rate of human papillomavirus in teenage girls has plummeted. And the research in this field continues to advance. On Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration approved an updated version of the Gardasil vaccine that protects against nine strains of the cancer-causing virus more than twice as many as the 2006 version, which covered just four strains.
According to DePinho, thats a really significant advance for cancer care. He doesnt want it to get lost in the ongoing controversy about HPV vaccination, a round of shots that some parents still worry is unsafe or inappropriate for their kids.
Theres a persistent myth, for instance, that giving teen girls the shots will spur them to become more promiscuous because they know theyll be protected from a sexually transmitted infection. Large scientific studies have debunked the notion that theres any link between the HPV vaccine and sexual activity, but inoculation rates still lag behind in some of the Southern states that are wary to provide teens with preventative tools to protect their sexual health.
In general, HPV vaccination rates in the U.S. are still much too low, hovering around 30 percent. Public health professionals are aiming to increase those rates dramatically, to at least 80 percent closer to the percentage of people who get vaccinated against the virus in other developed countries.
To accomplish that, the health professionals who have dedicated their lives to treating HPV-related cancers want to move the conversation away from sexuality altogether. Instead of framing Gardasil as vaccine that protects against an STD which might give some Americans the impression that they dont need to worry about it they want to present it as a vaccine that protects against cancer.
It doesnt seem like it makes sense to see it in terms of a vaccine for a sexually transmitted disease necessarily, Dr. Erich Sturgis, an expert in head and throat cancer who works as the program director for the MD Anderson Oropharynx Program, said in an interview with ThinkProgress. Most of us will have an HPV infection at some point in our lifetime and well never know it.
Nearly all sexually active Americans get HPV at some point in their lives, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An estimated 80 percent of people are infected at some point, and most never realize it because the infection resolves itself on its own. But certain strains of the virus go on to cause cervical, vulvar, anal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers.
Without the HPV vaccine, men in particular are put at risk of developing neck and throat cancers. Unlike cervical cancers, which can be detected with regular Pap smears, theres no way to screen men.
Sturgis treats mostly middle aged male patients, and he estimated that about 60 percent of the cancers he deals with are caused by HPV. He said its important to increase the rates of vaccination among both girls and boys because it will be another 30 to 40 years before todays kids hit the point when these type of throat cancers may start displaying themselves.
To let your kids potentially suffer later in life is just a tragedy. Thats really the message here, he said.
Both cancer doctors are optimistic that once more parents are educated about whats at stake, theyll start vaccinating their kids at higher rates. Theres a big information gap one recent study found that 70 percent of U.S. adults didnt realize the HPV vaccine has any connection to cancer whatsoever that they believe can be corrected with more investment from primary care doctors who are on the front lines of recommending the shots.

172,yes_86.txt,"Measles outbreak: Republicans left red-faced as vaccination row spills over into 2016 presidential race
Two potential candidates for a run at the White House have questioned the need for parents to give their children the MMR vaccine
The Republican Party is on the defensive after two of its leading presidential hopefuls indicated that they had sympathy for parents unwilling to vaccinate their children against infectious diseases, even in the midst of a dangerous outbreak of measles centred in California.
One day after both Senator Rand Paul and Governor Chris Christie publicly questioned the requirement for parents to vaccinate their offspring, the Speaker of the House in Congress, John Boehner, said all children in the United States should be vaccinated. So far the outbreak, which has been traced back to the Disneyland theme park in California, has infected more than 100 people in the US.
Mr Christie, the Governor of New Jersey, made his comments on Monday while touring MedImmune, a medical vaccine company in Cambridge, during a three-day trade mission to Britain that ended today. He told reporters accompanying him that parents need some measure of choice on the matter.
In an interview with CNBC, Mr Paul was more forthright. The state doesnt own your children, he said, adding that he had deliberately spread out the vaccinations of his own children so they didnt receive too many at one time. He said he had heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines. But he offered no details.
A so-called anti-vaxxers movement has grown up in the US in recent years, thanks in part to a widely debunked 1998 report in The Lancet, the British medical journal, suggesting a link between MMR vaccinations against measles and the onset of autism in children.
On Sunday, President Barack Obama told NBC that every child should be protected by vaccinations. And on Monday, Hillary Clinton, widely expected to be the Democrat nominee in 2016, added her voice in a mocking Twitter post. Playing the granny card, she said. The science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork. Lets protect all our kids. #GrandmothersKnowBest.

Mr Christie attempted to row back on his Cambridge remarks with a statement issued soon afterwards by his office in New Jersey. It said he believed there is no question kids should be vaccinated when it comes to diseases like the measles.
But by then his earlier remarks had already been seized on by the Democratic Party. Chris Christie isnt a scientist. He isnt a doctor. And he sure as heck isnt a leader, Mo Elleithee, a spokesman for the party, said. If his campaign is going to be about kissing up to the radical, conspiracy theory base thats wagging the dog of todays Republican Party, thats up to him and his cracker-jack team.
Among others leaping in to condemn both Republican White House aspirants was Seth Mnookin, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who challenged the anti-vaxxer camp in his book, The Panic Virus.
Their comments had been incredibly, incredibly irresponsible, he said, and fail at the first duty of a politician, which is to calm his constituents in moments of irrational crisis.
All children should be vaccinated, Mr Boehner said on Capitol Hill, while saying he wasnt certain if there ought to be another law to enforce it. Presently, the issue is governed by state-level laws with many states allowing parents to opt out either on religious grounds or because of personal beliefs.
The sudden surge of measles cases has alarmed the Centre for Disease Control which in 2000 formally declared measles essentially eradicated from the US.",15,31,23.741935483870968,0,0.520280517389377,0.2936332119205686,0.14762842542595334,0.1408304477069113,0.25806451612903225,0.3947115743885169,0.3748315089378875,0.23845375383447048,0.4165240318728087,0.1988315611473612,0.1878182992676424,0.10780445581944714,0.22506049581388116,0.08504445979038715,0.7425854908451267,0.14702021390412243,0.1469221240987288,1.2349301054285469,0.250957367343367,0.14444364452024414,1.2516434082878345,0.25156690862659886,0.1468070853612024,1.2575621412509639,0.25392317865972147,0.002105263157894737,0.08025974025974025,0.028169014084507043,0.03051643192488263,3.2444021491232196,3.65743806521765,0,0,1.173961182543272,6.589568616647508,9.187842936510437,-0.10811336581809766,-0.08920782253489182,0.2603763014614187,,-0.9390202944727507,-0.9893663593131696,-0.7647162529418976,-0.8111391351813977,0.23984225623683333,0.3124245285571066,0.3687645480142397,-0.004191979972008815,1.8890189676047087,-0.722930456865711,-0.431113499140162,-0.4149764697369348,1.3361514762547613,-0.2504390054016142,-0.15962597486383034,-0.19638280744603032,0.9095282459735523,0.9072117179556332,0.9854007771203063,-1.378175683310162,-1.6737942587637245,-1.3473663815771655,-1.514000837144936,-1.7435112465083504,-1.4434449384663262,-0.9203975176526096,1.624806465251386,-0.2786415429513986,-0.36312356514082145,1.322865714452453,1.5483161864206267,,,0.5414798209443181,0.07756584107817002,-0.42563866322136956,0,-3.874741123570133
173,yes_87.txt,"Dr. Stephanie Seneff: Senior MIT Research Scientist, on Vaccine Safety.
For those who would think that all we need to do is remove the mercury or separate the MMR into three vaccines, senior MIT researcher Dr. Stephanie Seneff makes it clear that the vaccine issue is much more complicated than thimerosal and live viruses. 
I first learned about Dr. Seneff last summer when I read the story, Warning: Half of all Children Will Have Autism by 2025 
Dr. Stephanie Seneff, research scientist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), made a dire prediction earlier this month during an event sponsored by the Groton Wellness organization. She said, ""At today's rate, by 2025, one in two children will be autistic.""
Seneff was leading a presentation that showed a strong correlation between the increased use of Roundup starting in the early 1990's and the rising number of autism diagnoses over the past three decades. In 1975, 1 in 5,000 children were diagnosed with autism. The current rate is 1 in 68, and it shows no sign of slowing down.
We are now quite used to the stunning increases in the autism rate, announced every couple of years, usually just before the media reporting frenzy during April, Autism Awareness Month, when we annually light the world up in blue and pretend that a debilitating disorder when no known cause or cure is something to celebrate. Each and every increase is accompanied by some official solemnly assuring us that they're not sure if THIS INCREASE really means more children have autism. No one ever questions the numbers or the willingness of everyone--the medical community, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and mainstream news outlets--to leave autism as some curious puzzle we just can't figure out yet. There is never a demand for answers. Never any alarm. 
When I read Dr. Seneff's prediction, I was stunned. How much worse could things get? This was certainly something that officials and doctors couldn't ignore. 
Incredibly Seneff's autism forecast didn't make the network news nor was there a New York Times headline: MIT Professor Warns 50 Percent of Children With Autism by 2025. 
There were autism websites that reported on the announcement, along with a story in Psychology Today called, Autism Apocalypse by 2025?--What would happen if the prediction by MIT scientist Stephanie Seneff came true? 
This piece was by Amy S.F. Lutz who seemed to understand that this was, in her words, ""a truly terrifying forecast."" Lutz noted that Seneff's background is electrical engineering and computer science, not medicine. According to Lutz, the fact that Seneff is ""still actively arguing that vaccines cause autism, a theory that has been repeatedly discredited through multiple studies published in peer reviewed journals"" also lessened her credibility. 
Still Lutz was troubled by what Seneff predicted. She wrote, Just last month, my husband and I were discussing that very possibility - as a hypothetical situation, not as an outcome predicted by a scientist at one of the world's most prestigious universities. What would we do if half of all children had autism? Would people still choose to reproduce? Would they be willing to take that risk? How would the government respond?""
I have to admit, my imagination failed me. I was a fiction writer in my previous life, and still I could not conceive of what we as a society would do if half the children born were autistic.
Lutz seemed to hold to the belief that children were somehow born with autism and that we're powerless to do anything about it. She couldn't imagine how our country would be able to provide for massive numbers of disabled individuals. She cited dollar figures that were not even close to what the lifetime cost of caring for someone with autism would likely be. 
Where was the demand to know why this is happening? We're talking about CHILDREN WITH AUTISM. Something is causing this. Why didn't Lutz show any concern over the lack of a comparable rate among middle aged and older adults? Do we just resign ourselves to nightmare of unending autism?
Sadly, this is the future. Autism isn't going away. The current generation with autism will age into adulthood with nowhere to go. More and more children will be diagnosed with autism. Evidently we'll be forced to recognize that autism is an epidemic of recent origin. We'll have to admit that something in the environment is crippling massive numbers of children. STILL, those in power will no doubt continue to blame factors OTHER THAN VACCINES. It can never be the vaccines. 
(As far as the charge by Lutz that Dr. Seneff has no background in biological science, this is from the MIT website:
Stephanie Seneff is a Senior Research Scientist at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. She received the B.S. degree in Biophysics in 1968, the M.S. and E.E. degrees in Electrical Engineering in 1980, and the Ph.D degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1985, all from MIT. For over three decades, her research interests have always been at the intersection of biology and computation: developing a computational model for the human auditory system, understanding human language so as to develop algorithms and systems for human computer interactions, as well as applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to gene predictions. She has published over 170 refereed articles on these subjects, and has been invited to give keynote speeches at several international conferences. She has also supervised numerous Master's and PhD theses at MIT. In 2012, Dr. Seneff was elected Fellow of the International Speech and Communication Association (ISCA).
In recent years, Dr. Seneff has focused her research interests back towards biology. She is concentrating mainly on the relationship between nutrition and health. Since 2011, she has written over a dozen papers (7 as first author) in various medical and health-related journals on topics such as modern day diseases (e.g., Alzheimer, autism, cardiovascular diseases), analysis and search of databases of drug side effects using NLP techniques, and the impact of nutritional deficiencies and environmental toxins on human health.
I recently contacted Dr. Seneff and we talked about her views on autism--the rate and the cause. I recorded her answers on Skype.
First of all, I asked about her forecast of one in every two children with autism by 2025. This was her response:
I've been looking at the curves of the increase in autism. It's quite alarming. This is what has caused me to devote all of my energy right now to try to figure out what the causes are. You see the one in 150, then the one in 88, now the one in 68, you draw that graph, you extend it into the future. What you need to realize, that one in 68, that's not kids being born today. That's kids who are already twelve years old. So we have to take that graph and already project it twelve years just to get to the people that are being born today. If you're talking 2025, which I'm saying, one in two, you need to extend that curve to 2037. If you do that, it's comfortable to say that it will be one in two, if we don't change whatever is causing this. And if it continues to go up on the curve that we already see, that's what it's going to be, one in two of the children being born in 2025 will end up with a diagnosis on the autism spectrum. 
Dr. Seneff explained what she believes is behind the epidemic increase in neurologically disabled children everywhere.
 I've identified three or four different toxic chemicals that I think are crucial to the autism epidemic, and these are specifically the aluminum and mercury in the vaccines, but also glutamate in the vaccines, which people don't realize. And in conjunction with glyphosate, which is the active ingredient in Roundup, the pervasive herbicide that is being used in huge amounts on the GMO Roundup Ready crops today. This has been a continually escalating usage of this chemical on the food crops--the core crops of the processed food industry, with almost zero regulation on how much residue is allowed. There's regulation, but it's hardly ever tested as far as how much is in the food. And so we don't know how much we're getting exposed to, but we can be sure we're getting exposed to more today than we were previously because of the usage of Roundup on Roundup Ready crops has gone up exactly in step with the increase in autism. It's a prefect match. 
Here Dr. Seneff advises parents on what they can do.
What I think people don't appreciate is that the vaccines and the glyphosate are synergistically toxic. The glyphosate is making the chemicals in the vaccines much more dangerous to the children than they would otherwise be. As I said, the glutamate is very interesting because glyphosate disrupts the body's ability to metabolize glutamate, so the glutamate becomes toxic and gets into the brain. I think that's the critical thing with the MMR vaccine, which has not been appreciated even by even the people who believe the MMR may be linked to autism. Until we can find a way to produce vaccines without using these toxic chemicals, we need to really worry about the extent to which we're vaccinating our children. We need to cut it way back. And if I were a young mother today, I would try very hard to get out of all the vaccines that contain aluminum, mercury and glutamate. That's a pretty big list. That's DTaP, Hepatitis B, MMR, the measles vaccine, the flu shot, all of those. . . . I would like to eliminate them. . . . If you don't choose to eliminate, you can actually delay--and that's much, much better than getting them on schedule, because a newborn child has a very weak immune system. To give that child a Hepatitis B which contains a substantial amount of aluminum is very dangerous. And now they've added the Gardasil vaccine, which has a very toxic form of aluminum in it, that they're giving to the teenagers, which is just on top of whatever load they might have accumulated up to that point. The U.S. has the highest vaccination requirements in the world, along with the highest infant mortality rates among the top industrial countries. If we're getting all those vaccines, it's somehow not compensating for whatever else we're poisoning ourselves with, which of course might be the case. . . . When you look at the risk benefit ratio of the vaccines, it comes out short. You really have to think about whether it's worth the cost. . . . Do you want your child to be permanently damaged in order to prevent it from getting measles? It doesn't make sense. I think we really need to question whether the vaccines are an obligatory part of a child's program. I certainly think they're not, particularly because they are so dangerous. And in conjunction with the glyphosate, which is making them much worse. 
Dr. Seneff is among a growing group of experts willing to speak out and challenge the safety of a one-size-fits-all vaccine schedule. Here are a number of others in science and medicine that I've covered over the past seven years.

That brings the total number of confirmed measles cases in the state this year to 10, all from either suburban Cook County or Chicago.
Officials said the new case is associated with the KinderCare center in Palatine, to which eight other cases also are linked. The new case involves an infant, according to Melaney Arnold, spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Public Health.
The eight other cases at KinderCare include two adults and seven infants, including one from Chicago, none of them vaccinated, according to city and county health officials.
The source of infection at the child care center has not been identified, and ""the focus is largely on identifying exposures and conducting contact investigations to curb the spread of transmission,"" said Cook County Department of Public Health spokeswoman Amy Poore.
Meanwhile, the first case of the respiratory disease that was reported, in late January, involved an adult in suburban Cook County. That case is not connected to the outbreak at the day care, Poore said. And it's not clear, she said, whether the cases are linked to the multistate outbreak of measles associated with Disneyland in California.
More cases are still ""possible,"" Poore said.
Measles is a respiratory disease that can cause severe health complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis and, in rare cases, death. The virus is transmitted by contact with an infected person through coughing or sneezing and can remain alive in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours.
Officials said the KinderCare children were all younger than 1 year old, meaning they were too young to get the vaccine that guards against measles, mumps and rubella. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians all recommend that children get their first dose of the vaccine at 12 to 15 months and a second shot at 4 to 6 years.
The illness is contagious even before symptoms arise. With that in mind, the DuPage County Health Department released a list Tuesday of three locations that people confirmed to havemeasles visited, warning the public they may have been exposed. The locations include Advanced Pediatrics Neonatal Medicine in Bloomingdaleand Hand & Stone Massage and Facial Spaand Jewel-Osco, both in Carol Stream. No one in DuPage County has been diagnosed with measles, according to Health Department spokesman David Hass.
As health officials continue to investigate, state legislators have started advocating stronger mandates when it comes to vaccinations. This week, four state representatives filed a resolution calling for state health officials to put new rules in place when it comes to vaccinations at schools.
State law allows parents to object to required immunizations or exams on religious or medical grounds.
Rep. Michael Zalewski, D-Riverside, said he hopes the resolution, which may be discussed next week when the House is back in session, will encourage state officials to ""tighten up (the) ways a person could opt out of a vaccination.""
Zalewski, the father of a 9-month-old, said he plans to continue to work on legislation dealing with immunizations as well since a resolution is a nonbinding advisory motion.
""This is a very scary time if you're a parent of a young child to know that there might be something out of your control when it comes to the health of your child,"" Zalewski said.",16,25,26.24,0,0.687457799911499,0.40017201674481234,0.13882472862799963,0.14185035496484488,0.04,0.3442039209817137,0.35171352802659617,0.1749703093644297,0.24761363643143947,0.24317786281130144,0.21521832412689684,0.10941538763183513,0.17796441537571983,0.0726835816697849,0.6167087670294629,0.1240755401481997,0.12730304833391873,1.0657065402753434,0.21393368026178097,0.15882403911463178,1.305247508752422,0.2651613536386358,0.15254879213340333,1.2931242635012248,0.26006581286819896,0.035526315789473684,0.04072420634920635,0.08571428571428572,0.0358148893360161,3.23907320637642,3.613585302074595,0,0,1.1718445866410225,6.652523252153794,8.941427685319441,-0.007098352301188288,-0.3484242702148129,0.7563214035964557,,0.4826189686430952,-0.1439502683696577,-0.8444184203972972,-0.8017459894879132,-0.6238941496144156,-1.0097793608045553,-0.3756311443008208,-0.604291592424062,-0.8080901191911145,0.7184065668280147,0.9606203657374232,-0.3875257350448757,0.13334508672314807,-0.5467138359912573,-0.5289872190705937,-0.5294417492833576,0.09126807126207824,0.04338149230223036,0.049888800470005386,0.14528929861890993,-0.5982795680013608,-0.18282508366920172,-0.7275198292713975,-0.9534347305250196,-0.7933478318091548,0.18889735446464564,0.296778279086161,1.4780437046551025,-0.07225374062869715,1.2473170931337503,0.8277995238803715,,,0.4979724243648783,0.2818639026550503,-1.288559911958934,0,-4.386054258959092
175,yes_89.txt,"Parents: vaccinate your kids
It seems like the more obvious something is, the more the conspiracy theorists dont believe it.
Celebrity claims linking vaccinations to autism have been debunked, and the science is clear vaccines save lives.
Smallpox, polio and measles are no longer the scourge they once were. The diseases were all but eradicated, but the vaccines success led some to believe getting a shot in the arm was no longer necessary.
Small pockets of anti-vaxxers began to grow, and today, Fraser Health estimates more than 30 per cent of children in the Vancouver area have not been vaccinated by their second birthday, as recommended by experts.
Why should you care?
Because when vaccination rates fall below about 90 per cent, the risk of communicable diseases making a resurgence grows dramatically. Witness the recent Disneyland measles outbreak, which is now up to 95 reported cases and still spreading across the U.S.
The only reason the anti-vaxxers feel safe is precisely because vaccines work. But as more forego the needle, they are literally rolling the dice with their own health and that of their children.
Reactions to vaccines are extremely rare. Yet, every year, we hear fear-mongering about the flu shot, and a quick Google search will find hundreds of links casting doubt on modern medicine.
But medicine is beginning to fight back. A growing number of doctors in the U.S. are refusing to see patients who dont believe in vaccination.
""Parents who choose not to give measles shots, they're not just putting their kids at risk, but they're also putting other kids at risk especially kids in my waiting room,"" Los Angeles pediatrician Dr. Charles Goodman told CBC.
That may sound harsh, but theres an easy solution. Do the right thing get your child vaccinated.

176,yes_90.txt,"Cindy Lange-Kubick: The vaccination debate, and the risk of loving our babies, Feb. 8, 2015
This story originally ran on Feb. 8, 2015.
I was one of those parents, the mom who spied a suspicious red spot on her daughters back one morning and blinked.
And then said something like: Yes, you can wear the striped shirt with your polka dot leggings and your patent leather Sunday School shoes to school; just hurry your fanny up.
And thought: Oh, maybe I was seeing things.
Or maybe that was chickenpox.
Well, of course it was chickenpox.
Her baby brother already had them, and her bigger brother would get them -- and a few days later, the first-grader whod trotted off to class contagious looked a lot like her polka dot leggings.
And I, of course, was a bad mom.
I feel bad all these years later, despite my rationalization that chickenpox was nothing much to fuss about -- and what about all that head lice floating around the halls of Merle Beattie Elementary? Now, those were the bad parents.
We are talking about communicable diseases again, and an outbreak of measles -- 14 states, including two cases in Nebraska -- and the parents who arent vaccinating their children against them, or against a host of other nasty things, in part because of a fear the shots lead to a rising rate of autism.
Theres a lot of hate directed at the Anti Vaxxers, as theyve been christened, like anyone who questions immunizations is on par with Obama Birthers or 9/11 Doubters.
My kids got all their shots -- and that tiny swallow of anti-polio juju -- right on schedule.
But I can remember holding their feverish baby bodies, praying they wouldnt be the one-in-a-million who ended up with brain damage.
Acceptable risk is all good and well when its a theory. It's harder when the baby in your arms is the flesh and bone your world revolves around.
And now there are more shots to worry over: IPV, RV, Hib. Unfamiliar acronyms for scary diseases.
You can worry, public health experts say, but get the shots.
Autism Speaks -- a leading advocacy group -- says the same thing.
So do doctors.
Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective, and theyve done study after study after study, said Lincoln pediatrician Alicia Cruce. Obviously, the risk-benefit ratio supports them.
Cruce has three children, fully immunized. Shes never seen a severe reaction to a vaccine in more than 11 years of practice. Shes never seen a single case of measles.
And I hope I dont, she said.
Her dad had polio, and his generation saw children die of the crippling disease, and others. Whooping cough, measles, smallpox.
She wonders about the backlash.
My generation has never seen these diseases,"" she said, ""and maybe were not as afraid of them as we should be.
Maybe. In the privileged West, weve eradicated the worst of the worst and are free to fret about picking the perfect preschool and weighing which jogging stroller rolls best on limestone.
Or maybe its Google. A validation for every theory, no matter how weak.
Or maybe its the ghost of thalidomide and asbestos and DDT and nicotine and mercury and everything that was once thought safe until tragedies proved otherwise.
Maybe its that the science keeps evolving. Maybe its MTVs Jenny McCarthy having a louder Internet voice than the head of the Centers for Disease Control.
Cruce listens to the worries of her tiny patients parents. If they want to delay an immunization, she lets them, but she puts it on them to decide.
She supplies answers. Shell tell them theres more aluminum in breast milk or formula than there is in the vaccine vial.
The measles outbreak concerns her, and the rising numbers of cases of other preventable diseases.
The sad thing about it now is were seeing kids pass away from these things,"" she said. ""Theyre not benign little illnesses.
(In the developing world, 1.5 million children younger than 5 die every year from diseases preventable by vaccine, including 118,000 from measles.)
An adult with pertussis might cough for three months, the doctor said, but he or she would recover. In a baby James age, it could kill him, Cruce said
James is my 4-month-old grandson; Cruce is his doctor.
Three weeks ago, he had his second round of shots in her office. He was fussy that night, and he was feverish for two days, and his parents were worried and so was his grandma, who would prefer he lived in a world without risk.
But who also knows these things: Before the vaccine, 1,000 children died from measles every year in the United States. Before the vaccine, 9,000 a year died from whooping cough. Before the vaccine in 1963, a rubella outbreak killed 2,000 infants and caused thousands of miscarriages.
The chickenpox vaccine was introduced in 1995, when the polka dot girl was in middle school. The disease that once affected 4 million a year, and killed 100, has been nearly eradicated.

177,yes_91.txt,"Measles Outbreak 2015: Dr. Sears - don't panic, easy to treat
With the recent measles outbreak at Disneyland in California, the media has caused a panic among parents prompting them to take a closer look at their decisions regarding vaccinating their children.
However, Dr. Bob Sears, a well-known pediatrician, states that the media- hype over the measles is unnecessary. In fact, according to Dr. Sears, the measles is an easy illness to treat and nothing to worry about for the average healthy child.
Children who contract the measles will display a rash and have a fever for about three days and experience a little discomfort. Afterwards, they will enjoy the benefit of lifelong immunity. Unless the child is already sick with a serious disease such as cancer, suffers from malnutrition, or has a health issue that has weakened the immune system, he should have no problems handling the measles.
Dr. Bob Sears encourages parents to make sure they understand all the risks and benefits of the measles vaccine and all vaccines before getting their children vaccinated. He also recommends an alternative vaccine schedule to reduce the amount of vaccines, and the added toxins in the ingredients, that are injected into children's bloodstreams at one time. Dr. Sears is not convinced that vaccines are unrelated to the autism epidemic and other childhood health problems:
""I generally recommend that any child diagnosed with autism not receive any more vaccines. Now, this is a very bold statement, considering that the majority of current research does not support a link between vaccines and autism. However, research has not proven there is no link, because no study has ever compared the rate of autism in a large group of un-vaccinated children with the rate in a large vaccinated group. This type of placebo-controlled study is the gold standard of medical research.""
Dr. Sears's position on vaccines has caused him to receive relentless criticism from fellow pediatricians in the medical establishment. He has been blamed for causing vaccination rates to decline. But he is determined to stand by the Hippocratic - ""First Do No Harm.""
Dr. Sears suggestion for a study comparing autism rates in vaccinated versus un-vaccinated children would be the best place to start in addressing a least one of the concerns that some pediatricians and parents have about vaccine safety. Likewise, there are concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines. Many children that are vaccinated against the measles, chicken pox and other conditions continue to contract these diseases and need booster shots. Whereas, children who get these illnesses naturally have life-long immunity.
As a parent, always make the decision that you believe is in the best interest of your child and allow other parents to do the same - there are no right or wrong answers.

178,yes_92.txt,"An affecting look at those battling the Taliban's murderous anti-vaccination campaign in Pakistan.
In Tom Roberts timely Pakistan-set documentary Every Last Child, courageous volunteers, the World Health Organization and local police join forces to combat the Talibans murderous opposition to polio immunization a problem that has led to a serious resurgence of the incurable disease that threatens to go global. Roberts examines the situation through the different perspectives of a polio-crippled beggar, the father of an afflicted toddler, a key WHO official and a family of vaccinators. Ali Faisal Zaidis vibrant lensing unites these disparate elements, vividly foregrounding the country and its at-risk children, and extending the films appeal beyond the merely informational.
The lifelong damage polio causes particularly in a country like Pakistan, with few dispensations for the disabled plays out graphically midway through the film as the camera tracks Habib Mehsud as he navigates the streets with enormous difficulty on a hand-wheeled bike, bemoaning his fate and finding hope only in the afterlife. Devastated father Zabih Ullah carries his afflicted baby son, whom he sees get fitted for leg braces that may help him achieve a measure of mobility and avoid a future as a beggar.
Roberts also highlights the work of Gulnaz Shesazi, who saw her niece and her sister-in-law shot to death by Taliban fanatics during a door-to-door vaccination drive, but who perseveres despite the danger. Roberts cuts back to her with other female relatives at various reprises: on an expedition to the beach, mourning at the tombs of her dead, mentoring other nieces in vaccination protocol. Her dedication and bravery register strongly, as does her matter-of-fact, completely natural approach, which cuts through any veiled exoticism that might mark her as other. Yet these qualities fail to fully justify the extended, somewhat disproportionate time Roberts allots to her.
The bulk of Every Last Child focuses on the larger ongoing vaccination effort as it seeks to deal with the murders of inoculating volunteers by Taliban militants, reports of which flood TV news screens. The film opens in medias res as armed police are given a pep talk and sent out to protect vaccinators. Buses are regularly stopped at checkpoints so vaccine can be administered to the children on board, affording Roberts multiple occasions for affecting closeups of kids.
Meanwhile, at WHO headquarters, Dr. Elias Durry, head of polio eradication in Pakistan, and his adviser, Babar bin Atta, spend frustrating hours on phones, struggling to come up with a solution to the continued Taliban attacks. One of the most fascinating aspects of Roberts documentary concerns the extent to which both sides of the conflict deploy weapons that seem almost stereotypical in their ideological strategy.
The Taliban exploits the somewhat understandable paranoia arising from suspicion of the West, sustained by the initial connection between AIDS and polio vaccine, and newly fueled by drone attacks. It adds to that flat-out lies based on cultural fears, stating that inoculation leads to premature maturity in girls and sterility in boys. Finally, the Taliban finishes off its arguments with summary executions.
The West-centered anti-polio initiative counters with political maneuvering, tying itself to popular local politicians. It also completely revamps its image by rebranding, dropping all references to foreign organizations and eliminating the word polio, presenting itself instead as the dispenser of a health kit against nine diseases (polio included). Well-protected one-day campaigns replace the longer drives, and Pakistan soon sees a significant drop in polio cases. Impressive though the results of the WHOs campaign to eradicate polio may be, it is Zaidis lensing of the streets, waterways and people of Pakistan that lingers in the mind.",8,22,31.681818181818183,0,0.5028198957443237,0.3439383339088962,0.33671733426551026,0.3432029327377677,0.13636363636363635,0.40445802051278695,0.37614901008805146,0.3486414017107476,0.32312639829058987,0.19051538444146876,0.16502210556108274,0.16179370050973915,0.15459275571960213,0.14217783741998508,1.2339097947030608,0.24411180306236965,0.1375951086389172,1.1833738125177578,0.2348097826867161,0.1544884287338454,1.3381239897088482,0.26476438633728144,0.15560008238620754,1.3417143282580424,0.2657404468933172,0.01990740740740741,0.021312021312021312,0.012345679012345678,0.012646793134598013,3.1991728373699218,3.633886633081943,0,0,1.1855762998771473,6.700692779324395,9.630472881280422,-0.8152184604364633,-0.4780324940547735,1.8366950514973572,,-1.0875016246782072,-0.5901807324801316,0.9471550463731999,1.0526717372882919,-0.24220536133749204,0.5675698006838843,0.4111878973787663,1.0373955605207308,0.3976743670453678,-0.9932216182936939,-1.5890042286083412,0.5050155627134877,-0.46355345147363486,1.118976792818271,1.282071510429363,1.2129735551827086,0.520522902848718,0.6440339265017057,0.5773847195357891,-0.3140270676367172,0.06135538422705515,-0.2168305039667499,-0.3095636485484545,0.12608096328847976,-0.1927808704920685,-0.3295176448260809,-0.3552915511272038,-0.7616806963336576,-1.3441145018808813,0.6816480642520436,1.1613576902112375,,,0.7802327712002205,0.4381818758890629,1.1244065666232006,0,-1.8873481427181598

Think you might have a touch of the flu?
Think again; if' you've got the flu, it will be more than a ""touch.
We've seen social media debates on whether or not to get a flu shot, and while this year's flu vaccine is not very effective -- only 23 percent, on average, more if you're younger, less if you're older -- getting a flu shot is still your best bet.
Officials will be meeting in March to try to decide which flu viruses will be prevalent next year so vaccines can begin to be prepared. With that much time lead, it's easy to see why they don't always make the right guess.
Still, flu vaccines are available, and you should contact your local health department or healthcare provider about getting a shot; it's not too late.
If you're still not convinced, consider this. If you get the flu as a result of not getting a shot, you are endangering everyone around you, including young children, the elderly and medically infirm.
According to the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 45 children have died from the flu this season, including four in the Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska region.
The CDC says 109 children died last year of the flu, a sharp decline from the 171 pediatric deaths reported in the 2013 flu season.
Influenza is not the ""stomach flu,"" but a respiratory virus that results in high fever, extreme chills, joint and body aches, dizziness, coughing and even pneumonia.
Because the vaccine isn't all that effective, it's important to stay on top of any suspected case of flu, treating with antiviral drugs if necessary, within 48 hours of symptoms appearing. There are expected to be enough of the drugs, such as Tamiflu or Relenza, available, although it may take calls to several pharmacies to fill prescriptions.
Meanwhile, to avoid the flu:
* Avoid close contact with sick people, and stay away from others if you are sick.
* Stay home when you are sick, including school and errands.
* Cover your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing.
* Clean your hands, and use an alcohol-based hand rub if soap and water are not available.
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
* Practice other good health habits, such as cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious foods.
Next Memorial Day, after you've taken in the services and decorated graves, stroll around the cemetery and notice the ages of people who died in the years following World War I.

180,yes_94.txt,"Measles outbreak: Low vaccination rates at some Bay Area schools raise alarm
With alarm over the Disneyland measles outbreak growing across California, almost 5,000 kindergartners enrolled in Bay Area schools are without proof theyve been fully vaccinated, a major concern as the highly infectious disease continues to spread.
Alameda County is home to schools with some of the highest percentages of kindergartners whose vaccination records are incomplete, according to an analysis of state Department of Public Health records, topping 80 percent at some Oakland Unified schools. On the other side of the bay, about two-thirds of the students at the private Waldorf School in upscale Los Altos Hills didnt have the proper immunizations.
Theyre not immunized, theyre not protected, said Amy Pine, director of the Immunization Program for the Alameda County Public Health Department.
The concerns over the low vaccination rates are growing as the state on Monday announced the measles outbreak climbed by another five cases to 73 in the Golden State, with another 14 cases reported in six states and Mexico.
More rain heading for Bay Area, forecasters say
Older students also lack vaccinations, but the state kindergarten data offer a snapshot of just how well schools comply. By law, starting in preschool, California children cannot attend day care or public or private school if their parents cannot provide proof they are immunized. Children receive their first measles shot at 12 months old, followed by a booster shot thats given at age 4.
But the reasons why so many kindergartners one of 13 in the Bay Area dont have up-to-date vaccinations is as diverse as the students themselves: While many lower-income parents struggle to get their kids to the doctor or deliver the paperwork, some higher-income parents are refusing to get their children immunized over concerns the shots lead to autism and other illnesses.
Since the measles outbreak was first reported late last month, growing public attention has focused on the controversial personal belief exemption cited by the second group. But less well known is that many students are being allowed to enter school with some, but not all, of their shots.
These kindergarten students enter on a conditional basis with the promise by parents to get fully vaccinated soon. Yet it is nearly impossible to tell if this promise is kept at any given school, since no formal process exists to ensure that these students immunization records are adequately kept and tracked.
Public health experts say schools must maintain at least a 92 percent measles immunization rate to achieve whats known as herd immunity. If enough people are immunized, it becomes very difficult for the virus to spread. Even the unimmunized are protected.
But if more than 8 percent of parents opt out of getting their children the vaccinations or dont complete the full series of vaccinations schools are no longer protected. The risk is not just for those who have chosen not to be vaccinated; its also for those who cant be immunized such as infants, a child being treated for cancer or a child with a blood disorder.
Pine has been watching the issue closely, for good reason: This school year, 9.68 percent of Alameda County students entered kindergarten on a conditional basis, well above the state average of 6.68 percent.
It is basically an honor system that schools are appropriately following up on those students, said Pine.
Dr. Gil Chavez, state epidemiologist and deputy director of the California Department of Public Health, acknowledged that.
There is no reporting required of schools on their follow-up activities with conditional entrants, Chavez said.
California is all too familiar with vaccine-preventable diseases. Last year, the state declared an epidemic of pertussis (whooping cough), with 10,831 cases reported, including two infant deaths.
On Monday, a California lawmaker said he will introduce legislation next month that would not only force schools to alert parents about vaccination rates at their childrens schools, but also inform them whether it is above or below what it should be to prevent the threat of disease.
You can look it up, but you should not have to look it up, said Sen. Richard Pan, D-Sacramento, of California school immunization data that is available on the state public health department website.
It should be on a piece of paper or an email sent to parents, said Pan, who sponsored legislation that made it tougher starting last year for parents to opt out of vaccinations. To claim an exemption, parents must now meet with a health care practitioner to learn about vaccines and diseases.
At the Los Altos-based Waldorf School of the Peninsula, only 33 percent of the kindergarten class was up to date on vaccines, and half were unvaccinated due to parents personal belief exemptions. We comply with state law, said Sandy Olson, the schools development director. Vaccination is an issue between a parent and child and their doctor. We dont get involved in that choice.
For most schools, exemptions arent the major issue. It often comes down to parents not following through with the paperwork, said Lynn Perkins, a nurse with the Emeryville School District. This school year, 28 of 62 students at Anna Yates Elementary School, or 45 percent, enrolled on a conditional basis but have since been fully vaccinated.
Its not really about immunization its because they havent submitted the proper documentation, Perkins said. We hound families to turn it in.
Many California schools, however, dont have full-time nurses on staff any more, so the challenge is left to school administrators.
It is something I have to keep doing, on a weekly basis letters and phone calls and having one-on-one conversations with families to tell them theyre missing a vaccine, said Roma Groves, principal of Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School in Oakland, which reported a 37 percent vaccination rate and 63 percent conditional rate.

181,yes_95.txt,"""Promising"" results in Oxford trials of Hepatitis C vaccine
A new vaccine developed by researchers at the University of Oxford has generated a strong immune response against the Hepatitis C virus in human volunteers.
The vaccine is the first Hepatitis C inoculation to reach this stage of clinical trials, and the results have been promising. The 15 healthy human volunteers who took part in the phase 1 safety trial all responded positively.
The Oxford University team, with colleagues from the Italian biotechnology company Okairos (now part of the transnational pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline) and Stanford University in the United States of America, have published their results in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Currently, the efficacy of the vaccine is being tested in a trial with intravenous drug users a group running a high risk of contracting Hepatitis C in two sites in the USA. This is aiming to discover if the inoculation offers protection from infection of Hepatitis C in this group, compared with a placebo.
The principle investigator Professor Ellie Barnes, of the Nuffield Department of Medicine at the University of Oxford, said, The size and breadth of the immune responses seen in the healthy volunteers are unprecedented in magnitude for a hepatitis C vaccine.
The study was funded by the Medical Research Council and the European Union, with support from the Oxford Martin School at the University of Oxford and the National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre.
180 million people world-wide are thought to suffer from Hepatitis C, which is a chronic viral infection. It is estimated that there are 300,000 cases in the United Kingdom. If left untreated, the virus causes liver cirrhosis in 10 40% of sufferers, and in some cases this could lead to liver failure and liver cancer.
Nonetheless, in approximately 25% of cases, the immune response elicited by the viral presence in the body of infected individuals is able to overcome the infection, and naturally remove the virus. This mechanism of viral eradication can be targeted by researchers to develop effective treatments against Hepatitis C.
In the past few years, new drugs have been developed which are effective against a number of different strains of hepatitis C. However, these are expensive, and require a prolonged course of treatment.
As second-year Biological Sciences undergraduate Natasha Gillies explained, An effective vaccine would possibly be a one-time preventative measure to inhibit the spread of the disease. Prevention is better than a cure.
Agreeing with this sentiment, first-year Biological Sciences graduate Ben Hopkins told Cherwell, In terms of large scale public health issues, its easier to get people vaccinated on a one off system than give people a long course of drugs, which either they might not take, or they may be reluctant to take.
The research team at the University of Oxford are using two separate vaccine formulations. Firstly, an immune response against the hepatitis C virus is stimulated by the injection. Eight weeks later, a second vaccine boosts the immune response to a suitable level for effectively fighting off future infection.
The researchers found that T cells, a type of white blood cell that is of key importance to the immune system and is at the core of adaptive immunity (the system that tailors the bodys immune response to specific pathogens), are crucial in eradicating the virus from the human body in those 25% of sufferers who are able to naturally clear the infection. The vaccine has consequently been designed to generate a strong T cell immune response.
The level of the T cell response needed to prevent infection is unknown, but the study compares T cell response levels generated with the vaccine to those observed in people naturally able to overthrow the virus. The study found that after the second, booster inoculation, all 15 volunteers had large, broad and sustained T cells responses.
Professor Barnes commented, The T cell response is really high, and whats promising is that this is a broad response. A range of different T cells are produced targeting different parts of the hepatitis virus. This is the first highly immunogenic T cell vaccine developed against hepatitis C. We found it to be safe and well tolerated in this group of 15 healthy volunteers. But we wont really know if it works if it is able to prevent hepatitis C infection until we have the results of the efficacy studies in the USA.",16,29,28.06896551724138,0,0.6915384988699641,0.4716362975757991,0.2932380571340521,0.29009837346772355,0.20689655172413793,0.3770068302524812,0.38538536704674003,0.23974659274746146,0.28389568733834913,0.21314378266194553,0.19584063681795325,0.10980928097075472,0.17055253053771421,0.09507327534144616,0.8181044530204138,0.16064870344238086,0.12882940705805454,1.1011946179620327,0.21820166354291484,0.15860760445068503,1.3569620558068674,0.2691699507338279,0.15993486678233065,1.3624903954940015,0.27037543991058927,0.016666666666666666,0.01746031746031746,0.03076923076923077,0.039160839160839164,3.1080856406482433,3.510982508064367,0,0,1.1894798076671007,6.645714841238674,9.375878091836114,-0.007098352301188288,-0.17561330509486553,1.1194291153441558,,0.5173203453659895,0.4231393760269709,0.5535257896754124,0.5635891679354078,0.03716997165635255,-0.15105535969417194,0.7085972757805735,0.008029035083577092,-0.2287495230548518,-0.25775672227556495,-0.02363361904524705,-0.38081368090297957,-0.05595012338104321,-0.010060805777393432,0.06197001988985965,0.0014448170710434631,0.1549284888707384,0.22453636945154892,0.15773190823086922,0.12236012033842371,0.4393230519683849,0.1605634739285325,0.284201539406374,0.5876586695374821,0.2977571377367495,-0.4370826914807871,-0.48467316745744343,-0.1992646947540096,0.11142912456290187,-0.6096985422096046,-0.8580012651461532,,,0.8604707898451286,0.2597694986259933,0.2328414034788367,0,-0.628496132102907
182,yes_96.txt,"Free flu shots all across Shelby County Tuesday
SHELBY COUNTY, Tenn. Shelby County Health Officials say turnout for free flu shot clinics is low. They hope Tuesday will see a bigger crowd as we prepare for the worst two months of flu season, January and February.
Dr. Helen Morrow told WREG, Its been really heavy in East and Middle Tennessee. Now we are starting to see it in West Tennessee.
This years flu got an early start, and it isnt showing any signs of letting up. Doctors tell WREG they dont expect to run out of vaccines during Tuesdays county-wide flu clinic, and encourage people to make time to stop by one of their locations all across Shelby County.
Deshaira Martin told WREG, I usually get the flu vaccine, [but I havent this year] just due to my schedule.
Martin isnt the only one. Shelby County health officials say theyve seen a lot less people coming in for their flu shots. Walk-in clinics at pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens are helping get some vaccinated, and they really want to make sure everyone is taking every step they can to stay healthy.
Martin explained how she stays healthy.
Personal hygiene, washing hands. I have a child so I have to take very special precaution, she said.
Several reports show this years flu vaccine isnt as effective as last years, but Dr. Morrow says its better to be safe than sorry. A weak vaccine is better than missing a week of work because you didnt come in and get your flu shot.
Its not quite as good of a batch, but that doesnt mean you wont get any protection from it, and there are three other strains in the vaccine, she said.
All Shelby County Health Clinics are offering the shots for free from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., but some locations are staying open until 6 p.m., so if you have to work late or you want to bring your kids after school, stop at one of these clinics.
Late locations include:

183,yes_97.txt,"Fagan ignores research
Regarding Steven Neills Feb. 27 letter, Fagan a voice of caution, which addressed Spokane City Councilman Mike Fagans statement that people have the right to choose to vaccinate or not based on their own research and moral convictions.
Neill states that Fagan is not saying not to vaccinate. No, when a public health board officer says that, he is saying it is OK not to vaccinate. Neill follows with connections to lack of prosecutions on the 2008 financial meltdown; to mandated swine flu vaccines, and to Food and Drug Administration promotion of genetically modified organisms in foods.
In fact, the shell games the bankers did were legal and still are; flu vaccines save lives, even when the virus mutates; the FDA does not promote anything (trust me, having done three trials under FDA guidelines, they are very strict).
Finally, parents can decide based on their own research? Concerned parents got 10,000 babies, split into vaccine or no-vaccine groups, and followed them for 50 years? Or, did they go to a website under the search, Do vaccines cause autism?
The first Nobel Prize in medicine 114 years ago to Von Behring was for vaccines. Fagan ignores 100 years of proven effectiveness; that does not allow a choice about protecting our children. Vaccinate.

184,yes_98.txt,"The Worst Possible Souvenir from Disneyland
Theres hardly any place more magical than the Disney Parks at Christmastime. However, this holiday season a handful of guests at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, got a souvenir they didnt bargain for: measles.
Nine people with confirmed cases of measles were at Disneyland or the adjacent Disney California Adventure Park in Orange County between Dec. 15 and Dec. 20, according to the California Department of Public Health. Three more people with suspected measles also visited Disney during that time.
[...]
Pamela Hymel, chief medical officer at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, said, We are working with the health department to provide any information and assistance we can.
If youre thinking, I thought measles was practically eradicated with those shots we had to get as children, think again. The anti-vaccination subculture deserves the blame for this outbreak.
Measles was once a nearly universal disease of childhood. Thanks to vaccines, however, it was declared eradicated in the USA in 2000. Since then, the country has seen 60 to 70 cases a year, usually people who were infected in other countries and diagnosed here.
The disease has returned in recent years, as more parents skip or space out their childrens vaccines because of misguided concerns about vaccine safety, [Paul] Offit [chief of infectious disease at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia] says. Dozens of studies have found vaccines to be safe, with no link to autism or other serious conditions.
Still, fears stoked by misinformation from celebrities and the Internet have done a lot of damage, Offit says.
The majority of these cases involve people who were never vaccinated, including two babies too young for the shot, but in one case, the patient had received all vaccinations.
Health officials have expressed concern over this particular outbreak, especially since it centers around a popular tourist destination.
The Disneyland outbreak is disturbing, Offit says, because it affects people who are likely to get on planes, where measles can spread easily. Two of the confirmed cases linked to Disneyland were Utah residents.
