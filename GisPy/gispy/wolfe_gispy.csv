0,discussion_0.txt,"A third feature of our data that may constrain unified accounts of modality effects is that the magnitude of modality differences is greatest when participants initiate their recall from the start of the list. This suggests that a major factor in determining the modality effect in both IFR and ISR is the greater resistance to output interference observed with auditory stimuli (including visual words that are read aloud) relative to words in the visual silent presentation condition (Cowan et al., 2002, 2004). One explanation for the resilience of auditory items within our data sets is that auditory words are stored with more enriched sets of features than visual items (e.g., Nairne, 1990; Neath, 2000), and that recalled list items interfere with the recall of as yet to-be-remembered items. If we further assume that the internalized voice that accompanies silent written recall at output is more similar to the internalized voice that accompanies covert phonological recoding in the visual silent presentation condition, then as recall progresses the differences in the effect of subsequent recalls (output interference) on visual relative to auditory yet-to-be-recalled items will increase.
A fourth and final feature of our data that may constrain unified accounts of IFR and ISR is the confirmation of inverse modality effects (Beaman, 2002; Macken et al., 2016): visual recall advantages that occur in early mid serial positions with medium to long list lengths. Consistent with Macken et al. (2016), we assume that the modality of presentation affects the way that all the list items are processed. We agree that presenting stimuli in the visual silent conditions may be more conducive to cumulative forward-ordered rehearsal than visual read aloud as the former but not the latter is unimpeded by the need to articulate or vocalize each currently presented item. We are also willing to accept that participants might either feel a greater necessity to rehearse the visual silent items relative to the words in the auditory condition in order to form groups or subsequences of lists and/or be less able to incorporate the current auditory presented word into a cumulatively expanding rehearsal set. The benefits of cumulative forwardordered rehearsal may be greatest not at the start of the list but at early mid list positions (see Grenfell-Essam et al., 2013), and the benefit may be greatest at longer list lengths, where there might be both greater rehearsal opportunities and where the difficulty in recalling unrehearsed early list items might be more difficult (see Ward, 2002). Currently, many contemporary accounts of IFR and ISR (e.g., the SIMPLE model, Brown et al., 2007; the feature model, e.g., Nairne, 1990; Neath, 2000; and the Farrell, 2012 model) do not incorporate an account of rehearsal. However, our data suggest that recall of read aloud stimuli is reasonably similar to the recall of auditory stimuli, and we do not find the lowered levels of overall performance observed in the read aloud conditions of Macken et al. (2016). Of course, there are many differences between the methodologies used in our study and that of Macken et al. (2016). Most notably, we used different tasks, an experiment-unique set of stimuli, words rather than consonants and a rate of presentation of one word per second that was slightly slower than that standardly used by Macken et al. (2016; 750 ms per word).
Our preferred explanation of our data is that the modality of presentation affects the processing of the entire list of items. We assume that longer lists are parsed into multiple groups (of varying sizes), and the presentation of each auditory (or read aloud) item leads to a set of more richly encoded features than those encoded following the presentation of each visual silent item. The modality of presentation does not affect the PFR, as each item within the same modality in the list is encoded with the same richness of features. However, the encoding of relatively impoverished written recalled items will create greater relative interference for the impoverished visual items than the richly encoded auditory items, leading to improved recall of auditory over visual items on later recalls. We finally assume that participants might rehearse in a cumulative forward-ordered manner with all lists, but they may be able to rehearse longer sequences of early lists items with visual silent lists than with either auditory or read aloud lists.
In summary, we have reported a systematic exploration of the modality effects across a wide range of list lengths in both IFR and ISR, contrasting visual silent presentation with both auditory (Experiment 1) and read aloud (Experiment 2) presentation. We have shown that the magnitude and extent of modality effects are similar across tasks when the list length is controlled, and we have also shown inverse modality effects in both tasks in early mid list positions for medium to long lists. We believe these findings encourage attempts to provide a unified account of both IFR and ISR. We believe that in both tasks, modality effects arise through the greater resilience of auditory items to output interference. Our data provide four findings that will constrain the development of such a theory, and additionally provide a rich data set that could be used to model the development of the serial position curve with each successively presented list item.",4,31,32.25806451612903,0,0.36749239268247036,0.3472302317419039,0.3628186311533985,0.3988527398294537,0.1935483870967742,0.3579120067069712,0.36473547164996467,0.4145095968793832,0.3688046096338805,0.22003514601079666,0.21042938349699292,0.27747268734953157,0.21761166405132976,0.17435830905365424,1.3801763753213148,0.2836695860431303,0.15949921733682623,1.3200220332829218,0.26703349774702717,0.16391724211336894,1.338156773789828,0.27171461354902027,0.15438516720558368,1.3143582830909883,0.26291538179234447,0.10445686210992333,0.04296980889129845,0.054945054945054944,0.028428093645484948,2.974170760676655,3.4254520394971375,0,0,1.0637094446771866,6.032281007522943,8.881720528970199,-0.8189859542883079,0.9978328790286897,1.210505767359093,,-1.3745864929267295,-0.3931860752592999,0.27738590520983925,0.6710272266465418,0.4348149634046466,-1.0768209127035,-0.7327206660656056,0.6974111705766524,-0.021156582571179038,-0.5541656216526027,-0.10224502143746894,1.1985411315988945,0.0777614932136136,0.9780945056142696,0.8141136470999152,0.8666210562559565,0.4208183364128991,0.3054923482338857,0.3453475690941584,0.3094020179522148,-0.23565345482260977,0.004411759050096755,-0.5855528275500884,-0.6611390570442458,-0.6950904295256992,2.262257624124955,0.25949184829833105,0.46931704286556425,-0.18637441547678577,-1.0945838295304278,-0.9443195867278473,,,-1.7960284392647496,-1.0988045360451604,0.28533562967808496,0,5.527259366189368
1,discussion_1.txt,"Finally, in contrast to these two views, which both assume that it is the timing of the events that drives the observed spacing effect, we must consider an alternative view that this effect is instead driven by differences in contextual variation between massed and spaced exposures. This account proposes that spacing benefits can be explained by an encoding variability mechanism (Maddox, 2016). According to Mensink and Raaijmakers (1989) and Raaijmakers (2003), the general context surrounding a stimulus naturally fluctuates over time and this context is encoded with each presentation of a stimulus. As the temporal spacing of repetitions gets longer, the natural context is more likely to vary and that variation between stimulus encodings increases the likelihood/ magnitude of learning from that stimulus. Hence, this account would suggest that the spacing benefit arises due to the increase in different encoded contexts for the spaced word-meaning exposures, which would subsequently make the meaning more available. This model is akin to the concept of contextual diversity (Adelman, Brown, & Quesada, 2006; van Heuven, Mandera, Keuleers, & Brysbaert, 2014), which has been shown to affect word processing (lexical decision performance is better explained by contextual diversity across word occurrences than by just the frequency of occurrence). Similarly, the One Sense per Discourse principle (e.g., Gale et al., 1992) is based on the finding that an ambiguous word encountered multiple times within a discourse is highly likely to be used in the same meaning across those encounters, and suggests that an interlocutor would treat one subordinate repetition and three subordinate repetitions within the same discourse/paragraph as equivalents because they both provide one overall piece of evidence about one meaning (as opposed to multiple separate/spaced pieces of evidence of that one meaning).
However, we believe that this encoding variability/contextual diversity/One Sense per Discourse type of account is less likely to provide an explanation for the current data. Although this account can explain the observed boost for spaced presentations compared to massed presentations, it cannot explain why three massed repetitions did not boost priming compared to one repetition, given that in Experiments 2 and 3 its two additional repetitions were presented in three separate sentences that did not link together into a coherent discourse. Even in the massed condition, these three sentences proRETUNING OF LEXICAL-SEMANTIC REPRESENTATIONS 17 vided different contextual information and were distinctly presented in separate pieces of discourse (each sentence was followed by the judgment of relatedness of a probe word, and the sentences were unrelated) so this should provide enough contextual variation to see an increase in priming (compared with one repetition) even for the massed condition and even though the overall situational context did not vary a great deal. Yet, the massed condition provided no additional priming compared to one repetition, despite its two additional and distinct sentences/discourses of varying contextual information. While contextual variation accounts consider the general surrounding context rather than context within the sentence, it seems unlikely that additional sentential context would not boost priming if context were such an integral factor in priming. This makes the contextual variation account an unlikely explanation for the present findings. Clearly, it seems that there are several possible mechanisms underlying the spacing benefit but, as aforementioned, this requires further research to disentangle.
Importantly, the observed lack of benefit for multiple massed repetitions is likely to be advantageous from a communication point of view, as these instances are not always representative of the broader word usage. For instance, a conversation with a tree surgeon might involve the tree meaning of bark multiple times in a short passage/ time-frame of perhaps minutes. If meaning preferences updated cumulatively with each of these repetitions, then this conversation alone would have a disproportionately large effect on meaning preferences for bark compared with hearing the same number of tree bark repetitions over a longer time-frame of perhaps days or weeks. In this case, the overly sensitive change in meaning preferences would be inefficient. In contrast, if additional word-meaning repetitions only alter representations when sufficiently spaced, lexical-semantic representations might still be somewhat sensitive to the listeners immediate environment but would primarily reflect the listeners long-term, temporally distributed (spaced) experience with word usage, which are more likely to accurately predict how these words are used in the future. Under this account, exposure to multiple instances of a word used with its low-frequency meaning would produce a smaller biasing effect on its lexical-semantic representation, and therefore this representation would more likely generalise to future encounters.
Adults lexical-semantic representations are updated dynamically in response to ongoing experience to reflect the most likely meaning of words. The present studies investigated the changes that occur as a consequence of exposure to the meanings of an ambiguous word. The results replicate the word-meaning priming effect and go further in showing that multiple subordinate repetitions provided an additional boost to priming compared with one repetition when these encounters were spaced, although this boost was eliminated when multiple repetitions were massed, at least in a word association test. Moreover, one repetition of the dominant meaning reduced, but did not eliminate, the effect of prior subordinate meaning priming. These results indicate that the experience-based changes to lexical-semantic representations are not solely based on the most recent encounter with a word meaning, nor does the effect occur with the same magnitude across repeated encounters. Rather, word-meaning interpretation appears to reflect the accumulation of recent experiences with wordmeanings, where the temporal spacing of multiple encounters is key to producing additional learning effects. This seems to provide a balance among the influences of word usage patterns across a range of timescales, such that listeners can dynamically retune and update their lexical-semantic representations in response to recent experience while maintaining their longer-term knowledge of word-meaning dominance.",4,28,39.25,0,0.6114801510616585,0.4854344418715863,0.586135013614382,0.534283347800374,0.21428571428571427,0.381022319784043,0.3612738277272645,0.3623199280771789,0.36521768834659873,0.20855322402591506,0.21092910298514658,0.2182653987636752,0.21094741269769862,0.15849635123591002,1.3522514985463538,0.26952161628274285,0.1587907050480839,1.342073998178671,0.27001591301645234,0.15430553018391252,1.3217212047362872,0.2637464310758337,0.15863435525120484,1.3372644100350202,0.26911802780411137,0.021708152958152958,0.026242567915955015,0.02857142857142857,0.025696316262354,2.8883673243326666,3.3335856188257207,0,0,1.0896307421040041,6.1411513143083045,8.838688907135712,-0.8189859542883079,0.6130644166782953,2.720461892605135,,0.4264789640694857,0.7405035931911544,1.8993533291271967,1.7235333072083938,0.5497710146536977,-0.5561876926148518,-0.8462705063877658,0.2945058177030769,-0.08818344992868958,-0.8843329570880248,-0.0814909298553754,0.43901422008820706,-0.12234853142181747,0.6549726987711486,0.7442894222966839,0.6928507629826698,0.3852469413307517,0.44825729112190266,0.4400469850897258,-0.5555490279228064,-0.5345524758910156,-0.6031148634743124,-0.12097590796363107,-0.22390951498074174,-0.1671092607117216,-0.3387213947406862,-0.2421520006371647,-0.2478565249328876,-0.38589171433274444,-1.8656482807936292,-1.9206414230250903,,,-1.2574123534290111,-0.7486054481900816,0.12144231982322709,0,5.594513918805488
2,discussion_10.txt,"A third limitation involved the research design. More specifically, the research design was a case study. The intact soccer team served as the experimental group and no control group was included. Though multiple sources of data point to the athletes use of the UNIFORM skills at posttest and follow-up, the absence of a control group makes it difficult to say with certainty that the experimental groups positive results were a result of them being taught the UNIFORM curriculum and not some other factors. However, the use of a control group in an applied intervention setting is not always appropriate or feasible. As noted by Anderson, Miles, Mahoney, and Robinson (2002), it is impractical to offer a service to one group of athletes and deliberately withhold the service from another group (p. 437). This was the view of the AD whose mission was to increase student-athlete participation, engagement, achievement, and retention. He felt strongly that if two teams were to be included in the study, that they should both be taught the curriculum. However, due to timing, scheduling conflicts, the length of the curriculum (i.e., 12 weeks), and available resources only one team could be included. As such, the soccer team was a single case, and though the results are positive, they should be interpreted with caution.
Despite its limitations, the current study makes a contribution to the literature on the development of sport psychology and life skills in adolescent athletes. This has been identified as an important area of investigation with researchers studying life skills development of athletes via applied sport psychology interventions as well as the perceptions of coaches, administrators, parents, and the athletes themselves (Camir et al., 2013; Sharp et al., 2013; Sheard & Golby, 2006; Trottier & Robitaille, 2014). It appears that a curriculum like the Psychological UNIFORM can be used to successfully teach sport psychology skills to adolescent athletes. Through multiple sport-themed, classroom-based activities and a physically active component, the athlete participants used several sport psychology skills according to the data collected during, and immediately following the curriculum period.
Few studies have measured athletes retention and use of sport psychology or life skills at a follow-up period after the intervention has been completed. In an effort to address this gap, data were collected at the 4-week follow-up point in the current study. The instrument used to measure the majority of the psychological skills taught within the UNIFORM curriculum was the TOPS (Thomas et al., 1999). This questionnaire is widely used to measure athletes application of sport psychology skills in practice and competition. At the time of the 4-week follow-up, the soccer season had ended. However, analysis showed some significant findings, even at a time when many athletes had no opportunity to use the skills in a practice or competition setting. Data from the EIS support these positive outcomes and are encouraging; they suggest that athletes who were finished soccer, but involved in other sports (e.g., lacrosse) maintained their sport psychology skills, and also that the athletes applied the skills to other areas of their life such as school, and when dealing with relationships. Thus, the current study makes a contribution by advancing the knowledge related to teaching sport psychology and life skills in the high school athletic setting in meaningful ways such that athletes use the skills during, but more importantly after, the conclusion of the intervention program. Regardless, researchers should consider using longer follow-up periods to determine the extent to which the athletes can retain their skills over greater time periods following the completion of the intervention program.
Given adolescent interest in sport and the accessibility to athletes, the high school site appears to be a fertile context in which to teach sport psychology and life skills to adolescent athletes (Camir, 2014). If integrated into training sessions, the GPF activities have the potential to be more authentic and engaging. As noted by a high performance coach, interactive activities were most effective in helping athletes learn life skills (Hardcastle et al., 2015). Regardless of the teaching organization athletes can and should be taught to use sport psychology and life skills. Though there is not one correct way to do this, with its multimethod approach and sport-themed activities, the Psychological UNIFORM appears to be an effective vehicle to accomplish this task.",4,32,26.1875,0,0.39868470873578543,0.3174152108455723,0.3601053090048178,0.3487018472482709,0.0625,0.3988188437393142,0.3816095401061816,0.4354406631333314,0.3751216756313813,0.22535666489663223,0.22889418279166693,0.22799982771835323,0.22946810514245208,0.17221817780436022,1.4135215681358666,0.2857359747976794,0.17142472282306026,1.413780687004663,0.2862961392137345,0.16328321394488274,1.3898909225584863,0.27672930208653196,0.1709402256877465,1.4099868300104235,0.2855904615951756,0.049275362318840575,0.04609833556702627,0.013888888888888888,0.045662100456621,3.016341292902113,3.4612984438928596,0,0,1.1854036364240446,6.448236215382717,8.367611395546902,-0.8189859542883079,1.1260890331454878,-0.10047401727638312,,-1.1443314861160012,-0.6377588066043784,0.2576787969041587,0.2812769318045298,-0.2916434160164404,-0.15526445361251787,-0.17921261567835628,0.8589994471190586,0.0968870294267849,-0.4011431822631817,0.6646254822976159,0.5638900746638716,0.43377938523689047,0.9344981801102561,0.8974909976233758,0.8920011627995819,1.0195473548723397,0.9124880924735297,0.9569863694080977,0.25234627892556855,0.7051893217424058,0.38675199792617565,1.2244631074101506,1.1642077543108236,1.2350560135466853,0.5277783233916656,0.35331522092881074,-0.6471163468206831,1.072323496240362,-0.7156223371312007,-0.563357455967766,,,0.7326431834690663,0.23918319157506626,-1.6727371528780373,0,2.6597473211149785
3,discussion_11.txt,"A final point before discussing the implications of the findings for parsing theories is that whereas the results demonstrate that the parser anticipates negation as a licensor for the genitive NP, they are not conclusive as to whether alternative licensors are considered in parallel. Recall that in the offline sentence fragment completion task (Experiment 1) alternative licensors for the genitive NP (in particular, adverbs) were offered, albeit infrequently. This, together with an active prediction of a negated verb in the online task, indicates that in the current stimulus set the combination of grammatical, word-order, and frequency considerations disfavours most alternative licensors. Yet, I remain agnostic whether, during online processing of the experimental sentences, the few remaining possibilities (in particular, numerals or adverbs) are fully disregarded or whether they are considered in parallel with the genitive-of-negation structure.
As mentioned earlier, the results from Experiments 2 and 3 are notable as they point to anticipatory projection of multiple headsthat is, the verb and negation. Thus they argue against strongly bottom-up approaches to structure building such as headdriven parsing models (Abney, 1989; Mulders, 2003; Pritchett, 1992) by demonstrating that the verb and negation heads are projected ahead of bottom-up input on the basis of preverbal arguments. Most previous research demonstrated prediction of a verbal head in head-final languages in which such prediction could potentially be viewed as a last resort response to a ubiquitous necessity to deal with preverbal arguments, as unattached NPs would regularly result in a significant working memory load. The current demonstration that verb heads can be predicted in Russian, a non-head-final language, is notable and suggests a wider role for predictive structure-building algorithms (see also Pablos, 2006, for Spanish, Omaki et al., 2015, for English wh-dependencies). In particular, the standard left-corner parsing algorithm (Abney & Johnson, 1991; Stabler, 1994, among others) in combination with lexicalized grammar can be used to explain the results. The left-corner strategy has a top-down predictive component that operates as follows: Once the first constituent of a phrase is recognized in the bottom-up input, the prediction of a subsequent constituent can be triggered on the basis of a syntactic rule. For example, once a NP is formed bottom-up (e.g., The boy . . . ), the rule S NP + VP is invoked, of which the NP is the left-hand-side constituent (i.e., left corner), which in turn triggers projection of a VP ahead of bottom-up input. In the accusative condition, upon encountering the accusative and dative NPs in the bottom-up input, the parser predicts a ditransitive verb using VP V + NPACC + NPDAT rule (recall that in Russian word order is flexible, and hence NPACC + NPDAT can appear before the verb and serve as a left corner) and incorporates the preverbal NPs into a connected structure. Negation is not actively predicted in the accusative condition on the basis of this rule and must be added into the parsing tree on the basis of bottomup input. In the genitive condition, when NPGEN is encountered it can trigger prediction of a quirky verb (on the basis of VP V + NPGEN rule), another nominal (NP N + NPGEN), adverb (AdvP Adv + NPGEN), or negative phrase with a transitive or intransitive verb NegP Neg + V + NPGEN or NegP Neg + V + NPGEN + NPDAT using a left-corner strategy (NPGEN is a valid left corner in all these cases as the nominal arguments can precede the head). The appearance of the NPDAT in the bottom-up input invalidates all alternatives except for the latter. Note that in the case above, postulating a lexicalized genitive-ofnegation rule NegP Neg + V + NPGEN (+ NPDAT) is critical for rendering NPGEN into a left corner that can trigger projection of negation and verb.
As an alternative to the account above that assumed a lexicalized rule NegP Neg + V + NPGEN (+ NPDAT), the genitive-of-negation may be encoded as a combination of structural rules in a grammarbased parser. In this case there is a rule NegP Neg + VP and a rule whereby the structural accusative case on the verbs direct object changes to genitive. In addition, the parser should be aware of the split licensing pattern whereby case and thematic role (on NPGEN) are not assigned by the same head. These considerations on what a parser should be able to achieve will hopefully trigger further research from grammar-based parsing theorists.
In conclusion, the findings demonstrate that in Russian, a free-word-order language, morphological case information is used by the parser for predictive structure building when it is available in the input ahead of information about the heads. Such an anticipatory mechanism allows projection of multiple lexical heads when a single head is insufficient for incremental incorporation of the bottom-up material into the parsing tree.",4,24,39.958333333333336,0,0.55951619601768,0.4185743248225122,0.5768022198134508,0.5367179294986711,0.08333333333333333,0.3890645488564457,0.3729929721009612,0.38261056526220943,0.3445971429166425,0.2040518098643848,0.2017100637827361,0.20169898543441506,0.19307080843045188,0.14500493742301113,1.2573728169367255,0.25137474805831156,0.15228324651458247,1.2950751017068758,0.26211540425406443,0.15138257818535625,1.2830039202291295,0.258804336705676,0.15235777951155544,1.284753460705303,0.2614457003237957,0.010776942355889723,0.011308458982877589,0.014285714285714285,0.022132796780684104,3.048136617796393,3.447580386533503,0,0,1.0981032114619902,6.677258926400148,9.443948126594176,-0.8189859542883079,0.1000398002111027,2.8734313039862704,,0.04289216012351716,0.19204979530179517,1.8315683894267114,1.7424537867031955,-0.17615516082642146,-0.37501093379328376,-0.4618557595042608,0.4511499682158529,-0.4735084829239345,-1.0137729516604186,-0.4643713026274338,0.2264958452172418,-0.6591361659949717,0.3801409246495799,0.5070518349249428,0.4699646056924414,0.05853506610447058,0.14398532250975077,0.1891853517229541,-0.8185833767203062,-1.2386691632973046,-0.979920227935058,-0.8072134176644159,-1.2262325347060001,-0.8201925453125023,-0.6823140588285468,-0.6900204743833029,-0.6363255408237157,-0.6461558873190841,-0.4298966624151317,-0.7091478204299052,,,-1.0813637472261246,0.975872072727241,2.4266758334184493,0,-0.18959858070460545
4,discussion_12.txt,"Considering observation is a skilled practice it is alarming to find trainees have received minimal to no formal training in it. Evidence from trainees suggests they are implementing observation; however there is resounding indication this is founded on instinct and trial and error learning, rather than evidence-based practice as is endorsed by governing accreditation bodies (i.e., BPS and BASES). It is fair to assume that at this stage of a trainees career, observation skill is relatively low, therefore training in this much valued assessment should be essential. Proposed formal observation training was met with unanimous consensus across all trainee participants, explicitly showcasing the merit in providing such a platform of education. Most salient was the suggestion from trainees to focus on the how of observation as opposed to what and why. This conviction is supported through Brown et al. (2005) claiming current applied sport psychology training as being proficient in the development of individual techniques (i.e., what and why), but which is not adept at educating practitioners in navigating the complexities of an ever-changing sporting context (i.e., how). It is anticipated the sharing of experiences and knowledge from a varied range of practitioners, will enable reflective discussion and take home messages regarding associated challenges such as, coping with the demand of multiple variables (i.e., teams), distraction, documentation, and perception. Attention should also be given to developing an understanding of contextual intelligence and its propensity to open doors to generate greater effectiveness in applied delivery.
Practical recommendations for enhancing observation practice have been interspersed throughout this discussion. We feel it is critical that our clients are educated on the purpose and intention of observation in an attempt to dispel any negative association or discomfort linked to being observed. By selling its positive implications, it is anticipated that applied practitioners will be less inclined to conceal observation, and instead confidently observe and integrate themselves into the sporting environment. Resultant immersion into the clients environment is recommended to help build a contextually intelligent practitioner. An increased presence, via informal observation, facilitates a deeper understanding of the complexities of a specific sporting culture, allowing practitioners to more effectively design and implement intervention. Furthermore, it is recommended to be seen in the sporting environment outside of normal working hours in an outward display of enthusiasm and interest. Both the client and key stakeholders within the sporting organization are likely to be recognizant of this which is suggested to increase acceptance and strengthen relationships.
It is important to reflect on possible limitations of the study. Consideration is given to the combined participant sample of individuals supervised from two different accreditation systems with differing outcomes and training structures (i.e., BPS and BASES), and the potential impact this may have had on individual experiences. Reflecting on each focus group and their responses to questions regarding previous observation training, it was considered that all participants, regardless of background or training pathway produced similar answers. Thus authors felt that all participants had similar foundations in observation knowledge irrespective of which accreditation system they were affiliated with, and therefore the differences in supervision across both training pathways would be minimal. Secondly, it is recognized that a wider group of trainees from a bigger sample of supervisors across the United Kingdom may provide a better representation than drawing from a small cluster of supervisors. Lastly, it is important to consider the impact of researcher bias on the interpretation of data. Due to the relatively small community of trainee practitioners within the United Kingdom, the lead researcher had professional connections with some of the participants used in focus groups. However, to minimize the effects of potential researcher bias, a reflexive journal was kept in which the lead researcher acknowledged any bias and unintentional influence upon data collection and interpretation.
The most influential message to have emerged from this study is that observation is perceived to add substantial value to service delivery, which is currently vastly under acknowledged. Positive properties already associated with observation, such as triangulation and confirmatory evidence (Watson II & Shannon, 2010) has been largely reinforced, however findings have uncovered other significantly valued traits of observation. A running undercurrent throughout this discussion has been the role of contextual intelligence as an avenue worthy of much greater exploration due its potential for unlocking many of the perceived challenges already attached to observation. Exposure and raised awareness of these associated challenges (i.e., trainee preconceptions and perceptions of others) is imperative for the advancement of our profession. Future research should be directed toward the development of observation training if the profession of applied sport psychology is to aspire and develop toward an ever effective and successful discipline.",4,29,29.586206896551722,0,0.49177891867501394,0.38916781282263435,0.4491270010226539,0.4193101852540932,0.06896551724137931,0.39603271952239416,0.3708122765880799,0.3639341518424865,0.38697666083504295,0.22063760677733088,0.20957682096117902,0.21846981181841757,0.21702924249407987,0.15575066807476742,1.3439543361392243,0.2660913066490235,0.15882052772693592,1.355799544119331,0.27006029987772473,0.15735350239043047,1.3480553724050688,0.26680759042714575,0.15776849149885722,1.3523390039405505,0.2689676758331819,0.006266666666666667,0.02175304583729338,0.03260869565217391,0.020336605890603085,2.909442232339377,3.356508430982022,0,0,1.1315124032221757,6.245774853068395,9.12148026468509,-0.8189859542883079,0.7413205707950934,0.6334999028495287,,-0.4571299359983945,-0.04917193599093207,0.9042515332333486,0.8300133378719937,-0.2558022333712621,-0.2180307527009176,-0.5333875613903937,0.3069676594948514,0.318414756725546,-0.5368416173393095,-0.1376532081646242,0.4416364853506299,0.06027289832350983,0.5990407568103234,0.7235429410207557,0.6507185050569735,0.3867442114680645,0.5371168005392657,0.4414563829973425,-0.2812642004982299,-0.05563647905460657,-0.36971963087644516,-0.21564347986875398,0.06383261646787562,-0.17990750990960347,-0.8240822212231134,-0.3767911284371676,-0.13807180305069705,-0.7773419630336097,-1.6762606167323744,-1.6770263796396017,,,-0.38715744263776414,-0.4120667819200527,1.1985016917749374,0,4.008600056765097
5,discussion_13.txt,"The current studys sample size was far greater than previous screener studies (Farvolden et al., 2003; Gega, Kenwright, Mataix-Cols, Cameron, & Marks, 2005; Storch et al., 2007). Unlike other studies that solely used undergraduate participants (Coles et al., 2007), the current study carefully selected established OCD websites and consumer conferences for individuals with OCD. Given that consumer conferences require time and payment by attendees, it is unlikely that individuals who attended and participated in the study were malingering. Where as other screening tools have been lengthy or difficult to read (Donker et al., 2009), the WHOS is brief, lowering participant burden. This brief screening tool may help screening for clinical purposes or research study completion and not rule out those without clinical levels of OCD, saving the screeners time and effort. The ease of administration, scoring, and interpretation, gives the WHOS an advantage over other screening tools that require arduous scoring and professional interpretation (Farvolden et al., 2003). In addition, the WHOS is free and readily accessible to clinicians and researchers, whereas many other screening tools are only available by purchase.
The WHOS is a useful measure when a clinician needs a brief screening or a researcher wants to reduce participant burden and in-person clinical diagnoses are not available. Given that the Internet has become a widespread venue for conducting research, it is imperative that a valid screener is used to determine OCD study inclusion and exclusion. We believe the WHOS has the potential to facilitate future research on OCD and improve the validity of online research, especially if future studies can validate how it compares with structured clinical interviews.
Despite the diversity in recruitment strategy and large sample size, there were limitations with the current study. The study lacked participant diversity in race/ethnicity, and evidence for differences in OCD severity across these groups is growing (Williams, Elstein, Buckner, Abelson, & Himle, 2012). The study would also benefit from conducting the screening with participants who are less familiar with OCD, such as university students or a clinic that treats an array of disorders. In doing so, the ability of the screener to detect OCD in a general population is likely to be strengthened.
Testretest reliability and correlation to diagnoses established by structured clinical interviews were also absent from the present study. To improve validity, future research should include a greater number of measures taken across all groups. The screening should also be conducted in more diverse venues of treatment-seeking populations (e.g., standard outpatient settings, non-OCD-specific clinics) as well as with participants from the general population and in comparison with a healthy control group. Although the WHOS has promise, we hope this initial investigation will spark more research to establish its validity and utility.",4,23,23.347826086956523,0,0.398101631001654,0.33878125976991985,0.40956122067644063,0.4268698073300942,0.0,0.39368815827700826,0.36251267297800793,0.3512093316981346,0.35232598791782693,0.22483879087699785,0.20337870225809732,0.18698302102836373,0.19930120541977486,0.17000376609686485,1.4293823264833632,0.2864898911446182,0.17131695573657518,1.434239423305596,0.2862811379542918,0.17128384595670076,1.420117885937198,0.28408436354176714,0.1706492245846565,1.4250405255466767,0.2853223237749593,0.020512820512820513,0.025427350427350427,0.08888888888888889,0.033816425120772944,2.99223958039041,3.4287409851581594,0,0,1.1778377567851253,6.660260256312887,9.178355046644802,-0.8189859542883079,-0.028216353905695445,-0.7137209542071475,,-1.1486356412615868,-0.4624930249150153,0.6168816317679255,0.8887633377497844,-0.6381081815864973,-0.270849443075621,-0.8056335478943413,0.20873177740976837,-0.32908371660470315,-0.4160348602748467,-0.39507027163701836,0.037715523365120796,-0.47205365231657986,0.8893886973943185,0.9371497279135788,0.9012610260117497,1.0141368268248767,1.0449384357137699,0.9565100405336496,0.9723174013512628,1.2549001187543942,0.9475317816968049,1.1926470534680034,1.451550980067037,1.2122316061159768,-0.3762933960776102,-0.266600075445553,1.3923459866061645,0.20716619582216592,-0.9322100931021384,-0.9093659067675065,,,0.5754325157343938,0.921193079574,1.4151190504815996,0,0.854681648976809
6,discussion_14.txt,"The use of Bayesian methods with this type of drawing predictor disposes of a methodological problem associated with the Hathaway and McKinley empirical item selection procedure discussed above. Selecting items for particular scales based solely on their correlation with a particular diagnostic group necessarily takes a toll on internal consistency. Dyer (1997) points out that the MMPI-2 manual lists coefficient alpha values that are only in the .50 s for five of the 10 basic scales. Heilbrun (1992) lists a reliability figure of at least .80 among the seven criteria for psychometric adequacy of assessment instruments used in forensic settings. In the case of Bayesian aggregation of individual predictors, however, it is essential that they not be highly correlated, in order to avoid artificially inflated posterior probability values (McGrath, personal communication, July 26, 2012).
One psychometric issue discussed in Lilienfeld et al. (2000) is that of incremental validity. Lilienfeld et al. stated that they are unaware of any research that demonstrates that HFDs offer psychologically useful information beyond that provided through other types of evaluation data, including the restandardized MMPI-2, psychiatric interviews, and demographic data. It has been the authors experience that subjects referred for forensic assessment are often highly guarded and defensive, concealing important elements of their personal histories in the clinical interview and responding to self-report clinical personality testing with extreme positive impression management, often to such an extent as to render the test record uninterpretable except as an indicator of defensiveness. It would therefore be highly informative to examine the incremental validity of drawing indicators over such self-report personality test scales as the PAI Violence Potential Index against actual criteria of violence. Many other incremental validity analyses could be designed that, if demonstrating a significant improvement in validity over self-report measures alone, could assist forensic psychologists in overcoming problems related to guardedness and positive impression management in responding to instruments such as the PAI, MCMI-III, and MMPI-2.
Ideally, drawings from the present forensic/clinical sample should be compared with a community sample to determine frequency of individual drawing indicators in the general population. This would also bring operating characteristics of the procedure in line with the statistics of the general population and permit a more naturalistic study of the instruments relatively low SPEC, which is presently a significant limiting factor with respect to the obtained validities. Incorporating the results of such a study into practical applications in forensic assessment would entail making a choice between the psychometric approach of scales such as the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III, normed on an exclusively clinical sample in the interests of generalizing to clinical assessment, and scales like the PAI that also include a community sample.
The use of drawings and associations with demonstrated empirical validity allows for culture-free evaluation in forensic contexts where subjects do not possess a sufficiently high reading level in English or in their native language to permit the administration of self-report tests such as the MMPI-2, MCMI-III, and PAI. Additionally, the lack of structure of drawing methods deprives subjects of cues as to how to respond. This characteristic has the potential to reduce impression management, in contrast to self-report inventories where the social desirability of item responses is usually apparent to even moderately sophisticated examinees.",4,18,33.72222222222222,0,0.4113667800145991,0.3308381496428731,0.30700714606791735,0.3416787221495594,0.0,0.37751190762455555,0.3457060521659034,0.3986052782164835,0.3613638131047614,0.2376717537933705,0.20211348032963716,0.2301321979745774,0.21882471902985817,0.14946981270669257,1.2793549696686244,0.25778186946946746,0.14998548109312737,1.288901600078228,0.25790460680040134,0.150860386623745,1.2911093992982865,0.25754552495162525,0.14946168392357465,1.2862234412712206,0.2570922189563807,0.034583333333333334,0.030170414380940695,0.04081632653061224,0.017959183673469388,2.902057857689611,3.3550393686532605,0,0,1.0975909031746596,6.484695469303881,8.986303412605835,-0.8189859542883079,-0.6694971244896861,1.5267006037876503,,-1.0507151479227674,-0.5276503879066876,-0.12797804387220266,0.22669634635424812,-0.6381081815864973,-0.6352708785646574,-1.356929161245868,0.5746294923219947,-0.16019874214124288,-0.04701779349636765,-0.4476168150427068,0.5912446898403231,0.11418635907723233,0.4710942978440568,0.5620166888929768,0.5486591028895873,-0.05682598395968913,0.10401792678789076,0.05548161709367994,-0.8655750199028845,-1.0912620518569152,-1.075897153150556,-1.1238525385144704,-1.1981737130968835,-1.1907692598980395,0.06597463451741306,-0.12435731939669534,0.0851169172592507,-0.9509786809930403,-1.7426195998903093,-1.6926390226485364,,,-1.09200895066327,0.3564603247445432,0.6836574735336878,0,4.022350523803886
7,discussion_15.txt,"Another contrast to human loss comes with honoring and memorialization of the loss. With human loss, many of the honoring activities are more expected (e.g., funeral, body care, obituaries). Of course, with companion animal loss, these options are less prescribed or expected. Participants from this study described their personal journeys to honoring and the associated benefits that resulted. The authors numerous anecdotal experiences support the true power associated with finding ways to honor. Some may struggle with not having expected ways of honoring as there are with human loss. Having discussions in advance acknowledging this and encouraging an embracing of the flexibility might be beneficial. As those grieving realize that the benefit of more flexibility is that the honoring can be more personalized and meaningful, they will embrace the unknown. Finding ways to memorialize the loss seemed particularly important for most research participants whether this was in a personal way or came through more formal ways initiated by veterinarians or family and friends. The absence of acknowledgement by loved ones appeared to detract the most from participants healing. As such, it is recommended that support persons already engaged in these honoring activities make efforts to include and invite other loved ones to participate.
The sample for the current study was a convenience sample recruited from a companion animal loss support group and an organization that assists with the memorialization of individuals former companion animals. As such, the participants may be more likely to value social support and memorialization processes than the general population of companion animal owners. The sample was also limited with regard to region, age, and race. The participants were recruited from two Midwestern cities, were mostly from older generations with a mean age of 61.83 years and were all Caucasian. More research is needed with a broader population in order to capture demographic differences and the range of coping methods found to be most helpful.
Additionally, the amount of time following the loss of the animal was not measured in this study. Future longitudinal research is needed to track the progression of grief and healing processes over time and to examine the impact of different types of positive social support on intensity and duration of grief following companion animal loss. This research could be used to enhance psychoeducational information available to veterinary and helping professionals and individuals experiencing companion animal loss and their loved ones.
The current study supports both the salience and uniqueness of humananimal relationships through this in-depth examination of relationship quality, loss, and coping. Comparisons to human relationships help to contextualize the salience of humananimal relationships. Emphasis on uniqueness highlights needs particular to individuals who have experienced the loss of a beloved companion animal. Grief is a universal process that is experienced when any significant loss occurs that is central to ones identity. The companion animal relationships described by participants in this study appeared to not only be central to their identity as an individual but also part of their larger family and support systems.",4,24,22.666666666666668,0,0.522974189856778,0.38645912251735537,0.538821836002171,0.5167735136368058,0.0,0.37230176176987034,0.3448309670628643,0.4070592800473761,0.36487240061722304,0.24205374884516445,0.20361131046758843,0.2396624039947277,0.20510422554038862,0.15599277074150986,1.274398435758958,0.2617572586181813,0.16075874676899576,1.3360568471245493,0.2704700137345797,0.15952187654022526,1.3295342142041588,0.2680038866828519,0.15562973646208417,1.3208860589372624,0.26445901217432866,0.06157738095238095,0.030415417915417915,0.030303030303030304,0.024875621890547265,2.9493859078276286,3.428612945650662,0,0,1.1245654597927326,6.25151290856178,8.459443517213941,-0.8189859542883079,0.1000398002111027,-0.8608219738473184,,-0.22685311506139275,-0.07139133300673373,1.5557133688012683,1.5874547116612017,-0.6381081815864973,-0.7526459657999526,-1.3856339546727092,0.6398945662158105,-0.09463565586894858,0.07898825601755739,-0.3854097076666957,0.7135007180664572,-0.29780414735707705,0.6039725976346535,0.5496232183418834,0.597486217305792,0.48405396374241905,0.40930211272163985,0.45446586003671335,-0.08613376978218676,-0.39246424797888657,-0.27850914138107696,-0.4494802072778826,-0.5365376152145848,-0.5636936398732438,0.9144585832232247,-0.11700975286022236,-0.20076937149157506,-0.4458317099049673,-1.3173105614186282,-0.9107266625928104,,,-0.5315072958444891,-0.39360939111094134,-1.3229787721947663,0,7.691918790159951
8,discussion_16.txt,"Self-report on physical activity, psychological wellbeing, stress and self-rated health may increase the risk of recall-bias. Personal interview is stronger than selfreport in reducing recall bias, and might have prevented the exclusion of participants who had inadequate answers in the IPAQ questionnaire. The drawback is that interview may cause interviewer bias. Prospective diary recording of migraine and co-existing TTH and NP together with personal interview may have been more ideal as diagnostic tools [44].
Detailed history and diary recording are particularly important for ascertaining multiple diagnoses. In the future, a larger sample of participants would allow for separate analyses of those with migraine only and migraine with either co-existing TTH or NP. This would also allow controlling for migraine disability.
There is a risk of losing power when collapsing responses into few categories, however, these categories are more informative and easier to explain to patients.
Migraine and co-existing TTH and NP was highly prevalent in a clinical sample of persons with migraine. Persons with migraine and co-existing TTH and NP reported significantly lower level of physical activity and psychological well-being; higher level of perceived stress, and poorer self-rated health than healthy controls. Persons with migraine and co-existing TTH and NP reported a reduced ability to perform physical activity owing to all three conditions with migraine as the most burdensome condition followed by TTH and NP. Persons with migraine and co-existing TTH and NP may require more focused interventions to increase physical activity. Whether physical activity is a beneficial treatment modality for this group is not known, and should be investigated in a clinical trial.",4,13,23.846153846153847,0,0.6773562940458456,0.4612020389579881,0.4521293882280588,0.39938399456441404,0.15384615384615385,0.363329099987944,0.3442474560884719,0.3083650420135301,0.3784592346094238,0.23758968400458494,0.222066047483234,0.2072604469385826,0.2198242755684381,0.2050835511311812,1.4911408812125515,0.31943468178464524,0.19033193913332483,1.4998240195160004,0.3088610451512976,0.2002558512981244,1.5341651637976883,0.3181070202686302,0.20284580896476212,1.5390791700887667,0.32277947097020887,0.06388888888888888,0.06458333333333334,0.034482758620689655,0.04827586206896552,2.968220642698302,3.3944268836779536,0,0,1.1019062453641892,6.583070019284973,9.245287954619311,-0.8189859542883079,-1.3107778950736768,-0.6061036779728495,,0.9127625643498324,0.5417250986786003,0.9260581476316624,0.6751559007125484,0.21472816443210432,-0.9547836772498819,-1.4047744496074983,-0.12202704996305784,0.15925419753619469,-0.049377743643978234,0.38104289469485547,0.2978397587899875,0.1442004256161164,1.6039942747257914,1.0915727265783435,1.30590042150815,1.9687984433324806,1.4695346645113658,1.6734806269948366,3.5794873316488167,3.328976142345032,3.5415574331089243,4.71279957011859,3.6283076379040353,4.400656081584542,0.9871145038584521,0.9076735541843005,-0.08711072525392424,1.263221429567082,-1.148054000999281,-1.2740432973003464,,,-1.0023408803929283,0.6728981000091243,1.6700445066576741,0,2.1629726944122316
9,discussion_17.txt,"The present results address two issues of theoretical importance. First, they provide strong support for a view involving the roles of spatial precision and flexibility in the splitting of attentional sets. As described in the introduction, a number of researchers have argued that the visual system can be configured in such a way as to maintain attentional sets for two different features at two separate spatial locations. For example, Adamo et al. (2008) asked observers to search for a green item on the right or a blue item on the left. The target was preceded by a non-predictive cue that shared the same location and/or colour as the target. Reaction times for target discrimination were shorter when the colour and location of the target were consistent with those of the cue. The researchers suggested that separate attentional sets can be concurrently maintained at two spatial locations. However, other studies have provided evidence against the configuration of such localized attentional sets for multiple features. For example, Becker et al. (2015) implemented a task that was conceptually similar task to the one used by Adamo et al. (2008), with the exception that the target was spatially accompanied by non-target items. The accuracy of target identification was impaired by the appearance of a distractor item whose colour was the same as the potential target in the other hemifield. Becker et al. argued that when splitting is required, attentional sets are applied globally rather than restricted to a specific hemifield. We argue that Adamo et al.s and Becker et al.s tasks may not be optimal for examining the spatial precision of attentional splitting because of the possibility that distractors would appear at potential target locations. It is reasonable that attention would be captured by distractors appearing at locations that observers monitor for targets. In this sense, the present study represents the first rigorous examination of spatial precision in the maintenance of attentional sets when splitting is required
Second, the present findings of set-specific capture (Experiments 5 and 7) highlight an aspect of attentional focus that is assumed to be involved during search involving multiple features (e.g., red and green). Specifically, Moore and Weissman (2010, 2011, 2014) argued that set-specific capture is triggered by a distractor of the same colour (e.g., red) as the target. The distractor results in the corresponding attentional set (e.g., targeting red items, rather than targeting oddballs) to enter a limited-capacity focus of attention in working memory (Jonides et al., 2008; Oberauer, 2002). They suggest that the set is briefly maintained, resulting in poor identification of a differently coloured (i.e., green) item because one of the valid attentional sets (i.e., targeting green items) cannot enter the focus of attention. Hence, processing is easier when the colour of the subsequent target matches that of the set in focus. Our results suggest that the entry of an attentional set into the focus of attention is not entirely automatic but is modulated by top-down control. If entry were automatic, then target identification should have been facilitated by a same-colour distractor preceding the target in the singleton-detection stream. Given that the apparent benefit of exposure to the same-colour distractor was demonstrated to be spurious by the lower accuracy obtained under the different-colour condition, reflecting a feature bias in favour of red items (see the inset analysis of Experiment 6, Figure 7), we have no clear evidence of a benefit arising from samecolour distractors. The elimination of the samecolour distractors advantage upon a reduction in the bias favouring red targets (Experiment 5) is also consistent with the idea that the entry of an attentional set into the focus of attention is modulated by topdown knowledge. This aspect of attentional focus has not been explicitly addressed in previous studies (Moore & Weissman, 2010, 2011, 2014) and is illuminated by the results of the present study.
Obviously, the present results do not indicate an overriding of one of the search modes by the other. If observers had relied exclusively on the featuresearch mode, accuracy would have been unimpaired under the different-colour distractor condition relative to under the control condition for both streams. If the singleton-detection mode was used exclusively, accuracy under the same-colour condition would have been lowest for both streams. However, neither of these patterns was observed. Of course these results do not exclude the possibility that the singleton detection mode was used with partial facilitation (e.g., Moore & Weissman, 2010). It is also possible that observers may have switched between strategies on a trial-by-trial basis. In that case, however, we would expect a consistent pattern of singleton detection for one stream and a consistent pattern of feature search for the other stream, although overall accuracy would have been low for both search types because observers would miss the target when it appeared in the unattended stream. This prediction is inconsistent with the present results.
To conclude, the present results highlight the flexibility, as well as the limitations, of the attentional sets used to monitor for the appearance of targets presented among multiple, sequential non-target items. Previous studies have primarily focused on whether two feature-based attentional sets can be concurrently established, whereas the present study was unique in addressing whether two different attentional control settings can be concurrently maintained. In other words, the central issue addressed by previous studies was the assignment of multiple features to multiple locations using the featuresearch mode. The present study extended the domain of investigation beyond the scope of the feature-search mode by testing for the possibility of combining search modes, as well as examining the limits of multiple feature-search strategies. The visual system was found to be flexible enough to maintain attentional sets when observers detected two singletons at different locations. However, the results indicate that the observers were unable to apply the singleton-detection and the feature-search modes concurrently in the same visual display. The system was not capable of maintaining a mixture of singleton-detection and feature-search modes at different locations, as shown by the disruption of a clear pattern in the singleton-detection stream. We found set-specific capture (Ito & Kawahara, 2016; Moore & Weissman, 2010, 2011, 2014; Roper & Vecera, 2012) occurring in both singleton-detection and featuresearch streams. The finding that the presence or absence of set-specific capture in the feature-search stream depends on the trial composition of distractor colours suggests that the entry of an attentional set into the focus of attention is not entirely automatic but is modulated by top-down control.",4,46,27.47826086956522,0,0.47135763267676034,0.360196735098922,0.4600061178849149,0.4119584739979413,0.17391304347826086,0.4232748532295227,0.4111999310103434,0.46432516545988617,0.43654022305196516,0.23176806945353745,0.23015288874110446,0.23931482822959094,0.24149522526350092,0.15342297057173454,1.301960180806529,0.26140933543088096,0.154879008714508,1.3064063704852587,0.26496214658694617,0.15599297627531863,1.290169701487325,0.26230795477787944,0.14952185241656268,1.2781326545430916,0.2582956182671892,0.019567901234567902,0.03034220856801502,0.03,0.028514851485148516,2.9802563519458136,3.413030983259064,0,0,1.0816871915435884,6.482342943286973,8.987181002243597,-0.8189859542883079,2.921675190780662,0.17827459041941932,,-0.607875502264609,-0.28682179823773896,0.9832675595414959,0.7728791278469133,0.3259676878258349,0.39568485325940284,0.7914199038030295,1.0819884192576712,1.2445823652143562,-0.21678063723464136,0.7169014074292758,0.7090419233181132,0.794922321780695,0.5516235444077772,0.6185394573527053,0.593212903514648,0.18885726971332706,0.21734422488612992,0.27957680028394527,-0.40369696740209765,-1.1083514970036896,-0.7127901438557949,-1.1172741303978073,-1.3526097286099743,-1.0883335939797723,-0.4059943454029825,-0.11920527445660388,-0.2090096233438048,-0.18003799511869115,-1.0398962401691574,-1.0763259101099496,,,-1.4224706080387115,0.34889304134466365,0.6869999241385085,0,5.743333397127115
10,discussion_18.txt,"The observed differences in judgments are stable if subtle. In Experiment 1, the space bounded by two vertices was perceived as being roughly 10% longer than the same space in the side condition at the physical distance of 32 mm. The difference was smaller in Experiments 2, 3, and 4. Importantly, the difference decreased in line with the increasingly stricter constraints, adding further support to our hypothesis. To illustrate, the difference caused by the change in aspect of a single equilateral triangle (Experiments 2 and 3) was about 5%about half the difference observed in Experiment 1. The difference was even smaller in Experiment 4 due to change in the physical properties of the stimulus. Yet the pattern of effects is consistent and reliable, and, as such, we believe it is worthy of further investigation. It should also be noted that the effects of local distortion were observed in judgment variability scores. Generally, the most salient effect was the inverse U profile, consistent with the increase in uncertainty halfway between the figure and the centre. Although no conclusions could be reached without further testing, the finding suggests that a parametric model of visual space must provide a thorough account of the effects of spatial distortion on response variability.
Our results are consistent with Watsons (1978) proposal that visual space can be locally non-Euclidean. Watson proposed that the geometry of visual space changes locally depending on the relationship between the objects that occupy it. He hypothesized that lines and curves in visual space introduce a force field, which distorts perceived geometrical relations with regard to the Euclidean geometry. He contrasted two approaches to this force-field theory. The first assumes that perceptual distortions affect objects but not the underlying visual space, which remains Euclidean (p. 142). Second, and following the failure of this model to account for visual illusions, Watson suggested that objects themselves affect the basic geometry of visual space, resulting in changes in distance between objects or lines. Using the assumptions of Riemannian geometry, he demonstrated that some well-known visual illusions (e.g. Mller-Lyer and Poggendorff illusions) can be explained by treating visual space as a smooth elastic manifold, which is distorted by stimuli. In this differential-geometric framework, the effects of spatial distortion decrease with the distance from a line or figure, and contractions in one portion of the field must be compensated by expansion in another (p. 146).
In this context, our results may reflect dynamic interactions, producing a gradient landscape that is not directly perceivable but has permanent and stable effects on perception (e.g. Aksentijevic, Elliott, & Barber, 2001). This landscape consists of attractors (troughs or basins), flat regions, and transition regions (hyperbolic paraboloids or saddles) that are created by two figures when these are sufficiently close. Critically, the configuration of the landscape changes dynamically with the change in size, relative position, and number of objects. The degree of distortion created by a figure depends on its size and shape. Larger figures affect more of the surrounding space, and different features contribute differently to the local differences in distortion. These two factors interact to produce different grouping solutions.
In conclusion, we report four experiments that demonstrate for the first time the effects of spatial distortions created by simple geometrical figures (triangles and ellipses) on distance judgments. Our findings indicate that different aspects of a figure create different local gradients in the surrounding space. They support the idea that, at least in two dimensions, visual space is locally nonlinear and that its extrinsic geometry (Fernandez & Farell, 2009) is affected by the mass and shape of figures embedded in it. Future research will investigate the interaction between mass and shape, effects of saddle asymmetries imposed by non-identical figures, as well the effects of spatial distortions on the propagation of attention. Incidentally, there is evidence that the distortions in a number of illusions (Zllner, Poggendorff, and Mller-Lyer) critically depend on the presence of corner junctions (e.g. Day, 2006) and that errors on a Mller-Lyer shaft bisection task increase close to the angles (Prebedon, 2000). Thus, one of the future directions of this research will be to systematically relate the strength of this illusion to the degree of field distortion.",4,30,27.133333333333333,0,0.531024878908848,0.39467950697945453,0.5196546253112573,0.4687486828615268,0.1,0.36381628137941546,0.37363542842967457,0.40778874920474156,0.39394305578995553,0.23537686455708284,0.2318086739937777,0.22803349465254055,0.2416226744183652,0.16641555519635273,1.4023291814543013,0.28246783212602133,0.16805128352572224,1.3996305167451843,0.2836600201041999,0.16191504535314502,1.3768200523670744,0.27516199298961996,0.16551538391438564,1.387281390120385,0.28039767524571674,0.018686868686868686,0.04426573426573427,0.015384615384615385,0.021445221445221447,2.98372059710174,3.420230350999668,0,0,1.0591293782470252,6.376309842435013,8.843516472335049,-0.8189859542883079,0.8695767249118915,0.10378513792077933,,-0.16742465007190654,-0.003959487575775124,1.4165001547709262,1.2142272177715752,-0.08376455667440626,-0.9438083687041615,-0.4407817220907134,0.645526083621537,0.44859202943531523,-0.11300826662988961,0.7856686250161413,0.5643219630876466,0.7987492863062394,0.8162937363037874,0.8695052081054415,0.8518606959954305,0.8501812846743774,0.8208795551617549,0.8732827541782182,0.12922577104494806,0.46748107495166963,0.26725398124509747,0.6313483162422054,0.7308089038753729,0.7930360432005862,-0.43368719034271985,0.2983561770733764,-0.6064433088321135,-0.6963734396491574,-1.0087651292951496,-0.9998137320876187,,,-1.8911971884543257,0.007820288844669933,0.1398289296076005,0,6.6928461297642245
11,discussion_19.txt,"Early reports have shown a relationship between patient and parental acceptance of hydroxyurea and their perceptions of SCD severity [20, 2426], which may indirectly influence hydroxyurea adherence. Parents who perceived their children as having a milder form of SCD were less willing to accept the risk of hydroxyurea side effects, particularly in relation to birth defects and cancer risk [20, 2426]. In contrast, parents of patients with severe SCD sought more information about hydroxyurea and were more accepting of its use as a preventive strategy [24, 25]. Different factors have been proposed to contribute to the decision of starting hydroxyurea in patients with SCD, including patients and parental perceptions. In a single-institution study, the majority of parents and patients were in favor of using hydroxyurea, which was perceived as safe and effective with balanced risks and benefits, compared to chronic transfusions and stem cell transplantation [49]. In our study, greater hydroxyurea adherence by patient self-report and higher MCV and HbF levels was associated with perceptions of greater treatment benefit from hydroxyurea, although the direction of any cause and effect relationship is not clear.
We also sought to examine patients perceptions of SCD and hydroxyurea in relation to their domains of HRQOL. Similar to children with other chronic conditions, children with SCD have poor HRQOL domain scores [3, 34, 36, 50]. In our cohort, patients perceptions correlated with different HRQOL domain scores. Patients with more negative perceptions of SCD-related consequences, concerns, and emotional response, or with less perceived benefits of hydroxyurea, reported worse fatigue, pain, anxiety, and depression scores. These relationships suggest an association between worse perceptions of SCD and/or hydroxyurea, and poor HRQOL domain scores. Nevertheless, given the nature of our cross-sectional study, we cannot determine the direction of the relationship, namely whether poor HRQOL leads to worse perceptions or that worse perceptions leads to poor HRQOL domain scores. Consistent with our results, ODonovan et al. have shown that, in a cohort of patients with congenital heart disease, illness perceptions were also predictive of different HRQOL domains and psychological outcomes, including depression and anxiety [51].
Some limitations of our study warrant discussion. First, our study was at a single institution and data were collected from a convenience sample of SCD patients, which could limit the generalizability of our results. However, our study helped to generate further hypotheses that could inform a larger prospective study. Second, the cross-sectional design of the study limited our ability to examine the changes in patients perceptions, hydroxyurea adherence, and different domains of HRQOL over time. Third, we limited our study population to AYA population with a relatively narrow age range (1222 years old). However, we focused on AYA because they represent a specific age group when patients start to take responsibility of their illness and be in charge of taking their hydroxyurea on their own, which make them at higher risk for low hydroxyurea adherence. Fourth, we evaluated SCD-related events (e.g. ED visits and hospitalizations) at our institution only and it is possible that SCD-related events elsewhere could have been missed. Finally, we used B-IPQ and MMAS-8 to evaluate patients perceptions of SCD and hydroxyurea adherence, respectively, and both have not been validated for adolescents or in SCD. To address this, we conducted pre-testing to ensure participants comprehension of different items of the B-IPQ and MMAS-8. Both measures have been used in published studies that included patients with SCD and/or other chronic conditions [14, 27, 47, 5254], and in particular, the B-IPQ has been used in studies with patients as young as 8 years of age [27]. In addition, objective laboratory data supported patients perceptions and adherence levels by self-report using B-IPQ and MMAS-8.
Perceptions of disease and treatment amongst AYA with SCD correlated with subjective and objective adherence measures, HRQOL domain scores and number of hospitalizations. Our findings enhance our understanding of patients perceptions of SCD and hydroxyurea and suggest that hydroxyurea adherence is a multifactorial process. Understanding patients perspectives could support efforts to overcome adherence and utilization barriers. [55, 56] Given the fact that hydroxyurea adherence is a dynamic and multi-factorial process, changes in patients perceptions of hydroxyurea and how it helps them maintain control of their illness could serve as surrogate markers for early changes in hydroxyurea adherence over time. Therefore, our results suggest that a longitudinal prospective assessment of patients perceptions may reveal modifiable factors associated with early changes in hydroxyurea adherence and HRQOL over time. Routine assessment of patients perceptions of hydroxyurea and SCD, adherence to hydroxyurea, and HRQOL in SCD outpatient settings should be considered using different platforms. Given the wide access to technology [21, 57, 58], web- or mobile-based platforms could be utilized to allow the completion of different assessments more frequently, and in-person or remotely in different settings.",4,32,29.4375,0,0.5569049134369819,0.4375104068763434,0.5626758848095225,0.5306522534910219,0.125,0.4084807902966675,0.38186594672432334,0.4153964372091075,0.37506237663088243,0.2834697922593669,0.24939328320362616,0.270208467140348,0.25834449164414797,0.1633513517675411,1.3402552883867966,0.2746620015210972,0.1639413977192406,1.3698832076211598,0.27960397803475195,0.1670953234344781,1.3882854614082907,0.285259333121053,0.16466749135898062,1.374116154638155,0.2790917682034994,0.03685897435897436,0.023149737453642377,0.06578947368421052,0.03315105946684894,2.907126803324124,3.371880686211991,0,0,1.1724232285506795,6.521463278736977,8.7505800195121,-0.8189859542883079,1.1260890331454878,0.601385634942942,,0.02361623052035214,0.3473825493851516,1.7289675191134088,1.695314067134486,0.05482134955361648,0.06240158715912255,-0.17080189198819976,0.7042575967792075,0.09577894092343105,1.2699234249161113,1.5159835289333887,1.1053537745725046,1.3008616886509266,0.7538732608600247,0.7142937277151846,0.7559867652172441,0.6438413607411229,0.6282947715272494,0.744492904163735,0.5953952710526228,0.6759922331235932,1.0371162386886639,0.5386455910859765,0.4795123885317603,0.6818747218541336,0.13750317705100454,-0.33490485686171645,0.7642074901511118,0.15857074333683327,-1.6970680002027452,-1.5136558211214424,,,0.4629245669128548,0.4747299770133184,-0.21413548562891152,0,5.761725149800285
12,discussion_2.txt,"As a potential caveat, it should be noted that it is possible that ToS influences motivational behavior by impairing instrumental control rather than by promoting aversive Pavlovian control. However, we believe that this is unlikely for a number of reasons. First, the present results are consistent with the previously discussed studies indicating that anxiety affects Pavlovian mechanisms (Duits et al., 2015; Lissek et al., 2005; Robinson, Overstreet, et al., 2013). Strikingly, a recent study demonstrated that avoidance behavior in mood and anxiety disorders is driven by aversive Pavlovian biases as tested in a similar Pavlovian-instrumental task (Mkrtchian et al., 2017). Second, in contrast to instrumental behaviors, aversive Pavlovian biases are evolutionary adaptive and rapid mechanisms evolved to avoid potential harm and increase survival (Dickinson & Balleine, 2002). They may therefore have a particularly important role in adaptive anxiety, which itself is likely an evolutionary adaptive mechanism. Thus from an evolutionary standpoint, it would make sense for anxiety, a state that accompanies potentially threatening situations, to potentiate a mechanism programmed to avoid harm, as opposed to disengaging the instrumental system. If anxiety instead impaired the instrumental system, it would likely lead to increased exposure of harmful situations because, as highlighted above, the instrumental and Pavlovian systems are generally aligned to facilitate optimal behaviors in nature (Rangel et al., 2008). Based on these findings, we propose that the most plausible explanation for our results is that anxiety influences motivational behavior via modulation of aversive Pavlovian processes. However, we acknowledge that these results do not provide definitive evidence that the increased inhibition under threat is driven by aversive Pavlovian biases. In light of this, interpretations are tentative and future studies are warranted to confirm the present results.
As a further caveat, it should be noted that the no-go conditions were not significantly different from each other. We might expect performance to be significantly slower in the NGA condition compared with the NGW condition as the Pavlovian and instrumental controllers both promote inhibitory responses (slowing of responses) in the NGA condition while they compete in the NGW condition. However, the response bias, HR, and FAR scores all indicate that the reinforcement schedules were in fact successful in generating an action bias. This lack of difference might be attributed to RTs in the no-go conditions being at floor levels. Indeed, there was no significant difference between the GA condition under threat compared with the NGA condition under safe and threat. This is perhaps surprising as we would expect the NGA condition to produce the slowest responses as both Pavlovian and instrumental responses promote inhibition (while the slowing of responses in the GA condition under threat is only driven by the Pavlovian no-go bias). It thus seems that the slowest participants can perform on this task is capped at the level of the GA condition under threat. It is therefore not entirely clear whether the effect of ToS on Pavlovian-instrumental interactions is driven simply by an aversive Pavlovian bias, or if it is specific to when Pavlovian bias conflicts with instrumental processes in an aversive context. Another possibility might be that the conflict between Pavlovian and instrumental controllers in the NGW condition promote cautiousness and slowing, rendering it similarly slow as the NGA condition. A final possibility is that this specific task is simply insensitive to appetitive Pavlovian-instrumental conflict. However, we believe that if ToS affected appetitive conflict as well, it would still have been revealed by the present task. Specifically, if ToS induced a general slowing of responses, regardless of an appetitive or aversive context, we would also expect to see slowing of responses under threat in the GW condition. This is not supported by the data. If, on the other hand, ToS induced a greater reliance on Pavlovian appetitive biases or impaired instrumental control in the appetitive condition, we would expect faster responses under threat in the NGW condition. Faster response times would be possible, as evidenced by faster response times on other conditions. However, this effect of threat was not observed. Moreover, the present results are in line with previous studies demonstrating that ToS only affects aversive but not appetitive conditions (for a review see Robinson, Vytal, et al., 2013). In summary, our view is that the most parsimonious explanation for the results that were observed is that threat impacts aversive Pavlovian responding. However, future studies might plausibly explore the impact of stimulus presentation duration on RTs to attempt to tease these effects apart.
Finally, it should be noted that our main analysis slightly deviated from the original study (Crockett et al., 2009) such that the first practice block was chosen as the response latency baseline as opposed to the first neutral block. Prior to analysis, we reasoned that this would be the most appropriate measure of baseline RTs in our study. Another possible baseline could have been the first neutral block during the safe condition, in accordance with Crockett et al. (2009). However, due to the counterbalanced threat manipulation in our study, only half of the participants experienced the first neutral block under the safe condition. Power to detect an effect would therefore be reduced to 50% with this baseline, and perhaps more importantly, the threat manipulation would no longer be counterbalanced, rendering it an inappropriate baseline choice. Future studies should include a neutral block before the threat manipulation to assess baseline RTs, so as to replicate the analyses of Crockett et al. (2009) precisely.
In conclusion, this is the first study to suggest that ToS selectively promotes punishment-induced inhibition in motivational behavior. Importantly, the present study provides a potential mechanistic understanding of this: Adaptive anxiety promotes avoidant behavior in potentially harmful situations by increasing reliance on aversive Pavlovian processes.",4,47,23.25531914893617,0,0.32261819338537345,0.27666051759396204,0.3417152563701261,0.3505189631519174,0.1702127659574468,0.40853741661982335,0.404686562820783,0.40141884849499404,0.3907188864370313,0.23784366083589006,0.22806168870931576,0.23830745358501434,0.2493391207205126,0.14599653673478044,1.2742036065807183,0.250954925371305,0.14628020384546825,1.2617159985902877,0.2494293709700373,0.14287000983559187,1.261983796904282,0.24875458036703485,0.1472828600410849,1.2760968306274065,0.25343164211082564,0.010168650793650792,0.02938034188034188,0.0,0.01948488241881299,2.8605924279934176,3.3243298061697826,0,0,1.0670066710002812,6.206524858578716,8.966896262368275,-0.8189859542883079,3.04993134489746,-0.7336984580061752,,-1.7058382360521298,-0.9720697124506168,0.1241101533103245,0.29539874345647343,0.30545543528514696,0.06367727498161485,0.5777665256973107,0.5963503146976679,0.3883437122160733,-0.04207453658815974,0.6300507682105115,0.6961190523202305,1.0304539711511984,0.40034066070768914,0.5491360614441373,0.4648081971985407,-0.24285222931858616,-0.07198230095373558,-0.21362909052245802,-1.5846232821243071,-1.6209433799104833,-1.7461545035874133,-1.3620701172096772,-1.3914693036289982,-1.5023646077194408,-0.7014340379430805,-0.14805130519642726,-1.0247945567145438,-0.8395481909323906,-2.115244755215202,-2.0190087257089577,,,-1.7275156982928246,-0.5383207870245093,0.6097420143507125,0,8.718597359564356
13,discussion_20.txt,"Moving further into the vignette with weighing the risks for the journey ahead, complexity is layered into why it is that the athlete struggles playing out the role of newcomer. Blodgett et al. (2014) referred to this struggle as navigating the outsiderinsider hyphen, wherein the athlete is never fully considered an insider or an outsider but is simply in a state of flux in between these positions. Within the previous, initial theme, the authors found the athlete referring to the earliest steps associated with acculturationgetting oneself rooted in schooling, a job, and in a physical locale, aspects commonly identified in acculturation scholarship (e.g., Schwartz et al., 2010; Steiner, 2009). With the vignettes expansion in this theme, there is an overt focus on what is already recognized as a delicate topicforging social relationships with peers (Berry, 1997). The athlete clearly wishes to belong among peers and yet finds that seeking this acceptance has become a series of trade-offs (Schinke et al., 2013). These tradeoffs include the beginnings of being ridiculed, first for not understanding what is being said and then later for the accent the athlete brings to social exchanges, when able to make oneself understood. These punishing formative experiences appear to deepen Ryba et al.s (2012) findings in sport contexts where there is a lack of interest in relatedness or understanding on the part of those from the receiving country. There appears to be a taken-for-granted assumption that the dominant group need not engage in any form of acculturation and that when they do, these are unusual experiences. Cultural learning seems to be imposed on the newcomer in a manner that deepens feelings of loneliness and isolation (see Blodgett & Schinke, 2015; Schinke et al., 2013). We find in this theme that for the athlete to be accepted, there must first be tolerance that one is going to be laughed at and stung. Furthermore, there will be no acknowledgment by the receiving culture of the emotional and psychological repercussions for these athletes, deepening the divide and distrust between receivers and the newcomer and sustaining the tenuous moves form positive to negative (see Blodgett & Schinke, 2015). Should the athlete accept and open oneself to these assaults, new friendships can be forged at the expense of tolerating ridicule and being systematically emotionally injured (Ryba et al., 2012). The hope is to become closer with peers, but what sits in the balance is the athletes feelings of humiliation or anger of becoming the brunt of a standing joke, with open emotional sores (Schinke et al., 2006). The question then lingers: Will attempting to learn the language be a step toward forging friendships, or might it materialize into having the newcomer constantly navigating the borderland between outside and insider, contributing to emotional exhaustion?
The sport psychology consultant has an important role to play in supporting the newcomer in this frustrating process, ideally in strategies that foster engagement instead of avoidance. The consultant is clearly not able to help craft a welcoming environment throughout the day, because the environment under discussion is away from sport. However, the consultant can follow up with the newcomer and seek to understand what sorts of social connections are being forged and whether the athlete is being ridiculed. The consultant might also help structure a functional network for the athlete among peer athletes to ensure that acceptance, at least within the sport environment, is adaptive and sensitized to the challenges posed by being a newcomer when away from sport. The aforementioned aspects place the onus of acculturating on the newcomer, and it should be recognized that acculturation is a highly interactive/social process. In addition to the direct work undertaken with the athlete, the practitioner might also reflexively examine where she or he might be contributing to feelings of alienation on the part of the athlete (McGannon & Johnson, 2009; Schinke et al., 2012). Some critical reflections should also be undertaken by consultants, by placing themselves in the shoes of newcomers with whom they work with and asking, How would I feel if I were in a similar new situation, where layers of unfamiliarity are being encountered all at once? The consultant might also consider, How would I want to be approached and supported if I were the newcomer? This shifting spotlight onto the sport psychologist would permit critical introspection, leading to sensitized understandings of what the newcomer might be undergoing away from sport.
The story then continues in the final theme, Public Stonings, with the athlete opening up a much deeper analysis of the pain associated with what it is like to acculturate. The athlete describes the initial shock of having to come up to speed with unfamiliar cultural practices and ways of doing things quickly upon landing in the receiving country, akin to what has been referred to as culture shock (Blodgett et al., 2014). In relation to experiencing culture shock, the vignette now exemplifies facets that the athlete associates with being overloaded with new information and practices to make sense of as part of second culture learning (see Rudmin, 2009) and why overloading happens, leading to the metaphor of being pelted by rocks, and all that it is associated with (e.g., ridicule, emotional pain). There are many commonly found aspects that need attending to, each its own rock, such as managing educational needs, struggling through new tastes and unfamiliar food, and living in a new location (see also Bowskill et al., 2007). While the athlete is experiencing these unfamiliar aspects of the receiving country and locale (see also Schinke et al., 2007), there are no supportive social connections to draw upon as guides, or as refuge, to help smooth the transition. These uncharted experiences are akin to what Schinke et al. (2013) referred to as shouldered acculturation (see also Bowskill et al., 2007). When there are no guides to link up with to help mentor the newcomer, much of the learning is gained firsthand. These attempts seem nerve-racking with many painful missteps, the first ones albeit tentative, that leave the athlete exposed and humiliated, similar to Tanakas (2014) professional rugby players, Meisterjahn and Wrisbergs (2013) professional basketball players, or Schinke et al.s (2011) boxers. In relation to these early catalysts, the sport psychology consultant can serve as someone who listens and seeks to understand how it is that the newcomer athlete feels overwhelmed when away from the training environment. The consultant can also serve as an initial contact person and social connector for the newcomer, linking the athlete to pertinent resources and community groups. This offering might continue, with the support of the coaching staff, until the athlete develops a social network of peers. Once peer relationships are formed, these people might begin to help mentor and support athletes toward settlement. Undertaking this broader support might avert athletes, such as the minor league baseball players Kontos (2009) identified, withdrawing from the receiving culture, underachieving in sport, and becoming underutilized and eventually deselected.
Within this project, a focus was placed on life outside of sport for national and international amateur athletes who became citizens in an unfamiliar receiving country. The vignette, comprising three themes, reveals layers of uncertainty that seem to serve as barriers to healthy social relationships outside of the sport environment. These uncertainties include, on one hand, recognition of the possibilities the unfamiliar country might offer and, in the balance, tenuous challenges that might impede the acculturation process. Although no clear solutions can be brought forth from a single project in relation to how any newcomer might navigate acculturation challenges outside of the sport environment, there is evidence that this part of the acculturation process (i.e., the nonsport experiences) is extremely delicate, highly social, and possibly damaging to the newcomer. Although solutions regarding how to effectively acculturate are not easily determined, it does become clearer that the role of the sport psychology consultant in relation to this process necessitates a holistic approach to practice, working with the whole person, in relation to nonsport life. Conversely, focusing exclusively on the sport context would be to ignore a sizeable part of the newcomers life during these moments of vulnerability.",4,54,28.814814814814813,0,0.3294575997970928,0.299057461493577,0.35447648665393194,0.35873014709348805,0.09259259259259259,0.38696859661716126,0.36594945321502315,0.39517872878778737,0.37042081188175185,0.1979957894519877,0.18947550027963866,0.20213526787496597,0.19331393208029257,0.1583929844089231,1.357344709687174,0.2691256906503506,0.15955659686687612,1.3642033612526594,0.2702663957580963,0.15831927209608715,1.36120453249151,0.2691632757485761,0.16048046000965638,1.3699399826902834,0.271546752195142,0.033796296296296297,0.024993431834070254,0.027932960893854747,0.028429546865301056,2.9981785647453756,3.4613773231575187,0,0,1.2118765493765493,6.233070462584949,8.846028942819443,-0.8189859542883079,3.947724423715047,0.46691252493795693,,-1.6553512004879842,-0.7883474953051887,0.21679614249455725,0.35921239058246607,-0.12482704740863527,-0.42222891651171324,-0.6928992933465674,0.5481764578729764,0.009044518878994254,-1.1879162811079136,-0.9724908725653235,0.23209259289024936,-0.6518357991604332,0.6528670270572642,0.7570246448200588,0.6879878664384711,0.4236991190972131,0.5915233116484983,0.4480004614529366,-0.1943552790581139,0.18349555616156138,-0.190112606078155,0.08086445605582988,0.39979809406339173,0.039628434825104836,0.04123628099640568,-0.27961313561361056,-0.265218268659852,-0.1862682785367319,-0.8788399728849999,-0.5625191567507626,,,1.2827212339757756,-0.4529325247513755,0.14939810422955144,0,0.7432499389662669
14,discussion_21.txt,"The most pervasive misunderstanding we found, which we term the investigational misconception, was that all research involves testing a new, nonvalidated intervention, whereas the actual goal of ROMP is to compare existing, approved interventions and fill gaps in medical knowledge about their relative effects with different groups of patients. The investigational misconception, which has not been previously described, manifested in different ways: some respondents said they would participate because they believed it was their only chance to get a new and beneficial medication, while others declined because they did not want to risk receiving a placebo or an untested medication. As ROMP becomes increasingly common, the investigational misconception is ethically problematic because it could result in both over- and under enrollment. Some patients might consider enrolling in ROMP because they believe it is the only way to receive a standard treatment. Other patients might not consider enrolling because of an unfounded fear of receiving a placebo or an investigational intervention, in spite of the fact that ROMP includes neither. To avoid these unwanted outcomes, efforts to improve informed consent for ROMPsuch as pragmatic clinical trials of multimedia consent tools, which have begun to show promise for overcoming this misconception25are needed. In addition, alternative study designs and approaches to notification should be considered and assessed to see if they may also help minimize misconceptions.
However, it is important to acknowledge that even significant efforts to improve prospective participants understanding of ROMP may fail to address all possible misunderstandings.26 Notably, the misconceptions we highlighted in this study were among the issues that our animated videos were designed to explain. It is clear that more work is needed to improve the efficacy of future educational tools, at least to the extent that these issues are necessary for prospective participants to understand. In addition, we also conducted follow-up interviews with a limited number of survey respondents for the purpose of improving future surveys; while we did not systematically analyze the interview data, those interviews suggested that at least some respondents continued to have misconceptions even after lengthy discussion. Thus, providing thorough education about all aspects of ROMP will likely be an ongoing challenge. Further research is needed to better understand the prevalence and persistence of the investigational misconception and other misunderstandings about ROMP, as well as what steps investigators can take to minimize their effects on enrollment decisions.
This study has two main limitations. First, the open ended questions were designed to allow survey respondents to submit brief comments and thus did not allow for expanded discussion or clarification. Subsequent qualitative work could continue to explore the themes identified in this study. Second, our survey presented hypothetical scenarios rather than actual enrollment decisions. Because this was an exploratory study and not embedded in an actual trial, the scenarios lacked some contextual information that would likely inform enrollment decisions. The specificity of the scenarios also limits our findings applicability to other types of research that could fall within a broader definition of ROMP or comparative effectiveness research. Therefore, we offer our findings as an overview of the range of factors patients consider, not as a definitive accounting of their decision-making process for a particular study. Further study is needed in the context of ongoing pragmatic clinical trials to assess participants actual, rather than hypothetical, reasons for participating.
Despite these limitations, this exploratory study is strengthened by the large number of respondents and the use of open-ended questions, which allowed us to identify respondents top priorities related to participation in ROMP in their own words and to describe the range of ROMP-specific reasons, concerns, and misconceptions related to study participation. This study provides insight into the important question of why people are or are not willing to consider participating in ROMP and offers a starting point for future research. Moreover, the investigational misconception may present an obstacle to recruitment and informed decision-making by patients invited to participate in ROMP; overcoming this fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of ROMP is a critical issue for future research.",4,23,32.04347826086956,0,0.5287222808057611,0.45124931871272594,0.49647351966372555,0.5194038122360195,0.2608695652173913,0.3718607469877981,0.38006424087280677,0.39612154766664276,0.37143490288969294,0.23413843106716237,0.224027456055121,0.2323409782123269,0.23373341441371207,0.16204264449104586,1.350092612208868,0.2721926081250065,0.16260133917466227,1.3589919291138866,0.2745487058438586,0.15514671841684113,1.3336355383741105,0.26718053984121776,0.15961711026125913,1.3456583499919044,0.27070080298924293,0.02808641975308642,0.033270822744506955,0.0,0.026875699888017916,2.8487543268924704,3.306660302380087,0,0,1.1082616466756783,6.1271842546481095,8.900186951081642,-0.8189859542883079,-0.028216353905695445,1.1641644029014135,,-0.18442193687172043,0.46008289614045883,1.248133652518221,1.6078962153274938,0.8080056225320009,-0.7625812248045037,-0.22990196591712905,0.5554550396651079,0.027994291687981974,-0.14861992520233291,0.46250310206289114,0.6195795126679383,0.5618554583106509,0.7272137611520613,0.73889127618603,0.7256568152729598,0.5765627084441843,0.5577843765842537,0.5839749075305884,-0.4798511036415371,-0.31787712687043557,-0.341284451503223,-0.013528251993291699,-0.06368694516680537,-0.032380390060361156,-0.1382380484697262,-0.03137720468060136,-1.0247945567145438,-0.2997545946829285,-2.2216267291586,-2.206793579634197,,,-0.8702826225848884,-0.7935327722460422,0.3556681644977633,0,7.669561348853978
15,discussion_22.txt,"As we hypothesized, gender differences were found for the three sexting subdimensions (i.e., receiving, sending, and posting sexts): Males were more likely to send, receive, and post sexts. These results may be explained by referring to the Italian cultural context. Previous studies found that Italian male adolescents are more likely than females to report that they find erotic materials enjoyable and arousing, and reported stronger positive expectancies about receiving sexts (Eurispes & Telefono Azzurro 2012).
Consistent with previous studies exploring the correlations between risky behaviors and sexting (Dir et al. 2013a), our study provided information pertaining to the relationships between cyber pornography addiction, alcohol consumption, and sexting. Nevertheless, results from the moderation analysis suggested that the relationship between cyber pornography addiction and sexting is stronger in those who have a high alcohol consumption. Conversely, alcohol restraint could represent a protective factor against engaging in sexting even in the presence of high cyber pornography addiction. Therefore, we suggest that the tendency to reenact the contents viewed in cyber pornography sites appear to be facilitated by the disinhibition effect of alcohol consumption. To our knowledge, this hypothesis was never been tested before and is in need of support among different age groups and cultural contexts. However, our results suggest that cyber pornography is not a predictor of sexting per se, because its relationship with sexting becomes weak in those who have a lower alcohol consumption. Thus, these results could be explained by the presence of a factor underlying all assessed dimensions (i.e., cyber pornography, alcohol, and sexting): as suggested by Krueger et al. (2005), there could be a common ethiological pattern for externalizing behaviors that involves both antisocial behaviors, substance use, and personality traits. Future research should investigate the relationship between cyber pornography and sexting in line with this perspective. Furthermore, our study may have research implications beyond clinical implications. Results could shed light on how to investigate sexting predictors and suggest that researchers should be careful in studying sexting antecedents. There seem to be other possible factors that condition (moderate) the relationship between these antecedents and sexting. In fact, the literature had shown inconsistent results regarding the link between cyber pornography and sexting (Crimmins and Seigfried-Spellar 2014; Vandenbosch et al. 2015; Van Ouytsel et al. 2014). To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies that investigated not only the linear relationships but also the interaction effects between the antecedents of sexting. This could also help to precisely identify factors that lead to sexting and to project more effective prevention programs.
There were important limitations to our study. First, we used a convenience sample and we did not consider how social class or ethnicity might interrelate with sexting behaviors. Second, the study was conducted in Italy, and these findings may not apply to adolescents living in other countries. Third, there was a possible effect of social desirability, as there always is when data are collected using self-report questionnaires. Additionally, using qualitative methods to further analyze the ways in which sexting behavior is placed in a context of adolescent impulsivity, sensation seeking, and problematic alcohol and drug abuse would also be of interest. Moreover, it would be useful to study the direct and indirect effects of sexting on adolescents development and provide suggestions for future policies and research.
Even if sexting could be considered a normal expression of sexuality among adolescents (Dake et al. 2012; Levine 2013), some characteristics of sextingsuch as the mass dissemination of explicit images, cyberbullying, social humiliation, psychological distress, and legal issuesrequire significant preventive interventions through law enforcement and education for adolescents, parents, and educators, as previously suggested by Martinez-Prather and Vandiver (2014). In particular, it is critical to understand the beliefs, attitudes, and risky behaviors associated with sexting and, consequently, to provide adequate sexual education to adolescents. In Italy, negative attitudes toward sexual education persist; hence, prevention programs should be developed to deconstruct stereotypes regarding sexuality during adolescence. It is our hope that this paper will contribute to the scientific understanding and promotion of psychological well-being for adolescents.",4,32,24.5,0,0.5502364933490753,0.42941775889090833,0.49957284673171887,0.46641889150388344,0.1875,0.38256372252686155,0.3807275695045857,0.3978708716484511,0.3792069389480776,0.23440384042138854,0.22898513003666368,0.2465269601367052,0.25615839392841394,0.1521093509304819,1.2709883949300536,0.2629178256505317,0.1596974905840744,1.333483303304798,0.2728812140683569,0.14926244170031583,1.2825899035667665,0.2557217421918474,0.1520039511286847,1.2989700477501762,0.2636788631644778,0.041087962962962965,0.0915607268548445,0.05555555555555555,0.030821917808219176,2.897194342267125,3.35924472467905,0,0,1.1787698412698413,6.3650841334650705,9.13386872623886,-0.8189859542883079,1.1260890331454878,-0.4649011443902635,,-0.025608620565835235,0.28099852676467363,1.2706443500539415,1.196121121911128,0.40128611512367335,-0.5214626990255923,-0.2081432692107208,0.5689598580009338,0.17322614604459405,-0.14098797130124618,0.6684026562853177,0.8015610776934199,1.2352188963044708,0.5248639755788057,0.5410966468785811,0.6117407058995896,0.43077279468292323,0.39264092909543874,0.5310277210886893,-1.009372934667161,-1.2461985147108863,-1.2149497644574074,-0.845898573136822,-0.9548679404852651,-0.6301014254035974,0.27042985038220935,1.7167157351588298,0.4859182828608987,-0.01153976978634452,-1.7863251204409665,-1.6479460773114383,,,0.594800207426654,-0.028289033870393283,1.245685271698247,0,5.038154805533267
16,discussion_23.txt,"Second, interleaved study requires students to keep active their knowledge of several procedures or concepts simultaneously, which might result in greater cognitive load [4952] and change their perceptions of mastery, negatively impacting their study decisions [53]. These potential drawbacks of interleaved study could have a more serious effect when compounded by the increased cognitive demands of self-regulated study described above. By contrast, in blocked study, the task is not as demanding on cognitive resources because students can focus on one concept at a time. Thus, self-regulated conditions could exacerbate a potential weakness of interleaved study. In sum, self-regulated study could mitigate problems associated with blocked study, aggravate problems associated with interleaved study, or both.
In recent years, there has been an increasing interest on how the sequence of study can affect learning [79,13,14,37,54] in no small part because students are increasingly in charge of organizing their own study, and may fail to adopt the optimal sequence of study [3] with potential negative consequences. In this context, we believe the current research raises two important points.
First, it is important to consider the possibility that apparently inefficient study decisions might be beneficial if the student is the one making them. Despite the large literature showing an advantage for interleaved study in inductive category learning, the present work points to possible advantages for blocked study. Importantly, the benefits of blocked study were only found when students actively chose it themselves rather than having it imposed on them. We believe more work is needed to investigate how the best sequence may depend on the study situation, and the importance of self-regulation in the context of studying decisions.
Secondly, from a methodological point of view, this experiment can serve as a model for carefully controlled research in naturalistic contexts and pedagogically relevant issues. The effect of self-regulation described here, albeit small, was found in the context of students real study experience, very different from the common laboratory study. Although this methodology might present lower measurement resolution (only four test questions) and increased measurement noise resulting in decreased power compared to the usual laboratory study, it has considerable ecological validity. Moreover, in contrast to many classroom studies, online distribution of the tutorial allowed considerable control over the intervention and precise recording of the students behavior for inclusion in subsequent analyses. We believe that similar in vivo yet individually-controlled studies of learning in educational contexts [41,55] represent a major potential growth area for cognitive science.",4,16,29.5625,0,0.5164519836505254,0.478738276536266,0.432276778233548,0.47180812023580077,0.1875,0.35500413807177983,0.3475144446638541,0.365332006004432,0.3561324174982806,0.2369302674714062,0.20626997643586262,0.2162852457062238,0.2148024187439987,0.15405327530280408,1.31036429687801,0.2596197248508969,0.15835951323444936,1.3485303194937905,0.2671666734696567,0.15674073004101566,1.3442608149576014,0.2667922750257965,0.1572241963044715,1.3387686439328321,0.26533398757001747,0.019444444444444445,0.026171197223828803,0.037037037037037035,0.02154882154882155,2.88030581018451,3.321478002574536,0,0,1.0835493664973435,6.338593910761324,8.476678799942036,-0.8189859542883079,-0.9260094327232825,0.6283802369513776,,-0.27499864654019657,0.6855749231328008,0.7818668154240553,1.238003795959963,0.40128611512367335,-1.1423298915773725,-1.2976097500159787,0.3177591233479551,-0.25795501592777315,-0.0683395341863946,-0.2749913663776117,0.41361228779293563,-0.006592790234997151,0.5644633972118946,0.6395533688759857,0.5712322829312257,0.3635986303519703,0.49005566819067,0.34957624351354505,-0.33640714364921254,-0.12464470765570197,-0.37088733933262374,-0.2751529631014429,-0.19519686967393293,-0.48921404983653055,-0.40987487144549345,-0.24429238163317937,-0.017652663664248763,-0.6888069325980596,-1.938092313898306,-2.0493166238780702,,,-1.383776658109522,-0.11349915315681604,-1.2573352428047624,0,9.05960885656187
17,discussion_24.txt,"As is the case with any study, the present investigation has several limitations. First, the present study uses a rather brief (eight-item) measure of neuroticism. A longer, more detailed measure that is designed to specifically measure neuroticism, or perhaps multiple measures with convergent validity, may be more appropriate for future studies on the relation between neuroticism, mind-wandering, and executive control. Second, the mind-wandering construct was drawn from rates of mind-wandering during the attention control tasks. In the future, these measurements can be combined with other indices of mind-wandering (e.g., diaries, experience sampling) to corroborate the findings of mind-wandering in the lab. Third, the present study does not measure other closely related aspects of neuroticism such as negative affect, mood, anxiety, and worry, nor does it ask participants to report any recent life events that may impact their cognitive performance and ability to resist mind-wandering beyond their personality traits. For example, if an individual recently experienced a personal crisis or has a stressful upcoming event in the near future, they may be more prone to mind-wandering about such an important personal event, which could be totally independent of their stable personality traits. Future work should measure both state (i.e., temporally specific) factors and trait factors that can contribute to the relationship between emotion and cognition. Finally, the tasks inherently carry a level of explicit and implicit feedback that may be unintentionally inducing test anxiety. This procedure-induced test anxiety could be affecting task performance, especially for those individuals high in neuroticism and thus more predisposed to experiencing anxious thoughts and feelings.
We should also note that a previous investigation by one of the authors (Unsworth et al., 2009) found a null correlation between neuroticism and one measure of working memory (operation span) and neuroticism and attention control/inhibition. There are several possible reasons for the discrepancies in these findings. The first is that the personality measurement in Unsworth et al. (2009) was the 280- item Revised NEO Personality Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1992), and the present study used a 44-item Big Five Inventory. Although the measures of neuroticism in the two measures are moderately to highly correlated, they are not identical (Rammstedt & John, 2007). So it is possible that the subtle differences in these two measures can explain the discrepant findings. We acknowledged earlier that one element of the present study is the use of only one measure of neuroticism, so it is possible that these measures may be tapping slightly different aspects of neuroticism that have different relationships with mind-wandering and executive control. Another possibility is a difference in procedure. In Unsworth et al.s (2009) study, participants completed laboratory measures of working memory, vigilance, fluid intelligence, fluency, and response inhibition in one laboratory session and completed a battery of personality questionnaires in a separate session. In the current study, participants completed the Big Five Inventory immediately following the working memory and attention control measures. It is possible that the procedure, especially considering the discussion of possible testing anxiety mentioned earlier, may have altered which neuroticism items individuals tended to endorse. Follow-up research should investigate this possibility, as well as use multiple measures in an attempt to measure neuroticism with perhaps more convergent validity. Finally, there could simply be differences in samples between the two studies.
Even with these limitations, the present study makes several novel findings in the field of mind-wandering and human cognition. Tests of the Control Failure Concerns model of mind-wandering have largely focused on individual differences in executive control and their relationships to mind-wandering rates. The personal concerns piece has received considerably less attention, especially from an individual differences perspective. Recent experimental evidence (e.g., Banks et al., 2015; McVay & Kane, 2013) has suggested that priming personal concerns, and perhaps especially negative ones, leads to more mind-wandering, and this effect seems to be particularly pronounced among individuals with high stress reactivity. Because of the large sample and the ability to use structural equation modelling to partial common and unique variance among executive control, neuroticism, and mind wandering, we were able to further delineate sources of mind-wandering. Therefore, we have given further credence and clarification to the Control Failure Concerns model of mind-wandering and opened doors for future research.
Mind-wandering relates to a variety of important areas of human functioning, including basic cognition, higher order cognition, daily success, happiness, and even certain types of psychopathology. Therefore, a more complete understanding of mind-wandering will aid our ability to understand how and when it occurs, when it is detrimental and when it may help, and how it can inform models of human cognition and emotion. We set out to test the Control Failure Concerns model of mind-wandering by measuring individual differences in neuroticism, which should measure an individuals tendency to entertain personal concerns, or similarly the relative salience of personal concern to individuals. By finding relationships among neuroticism, executive control, and mind-wandering, the present study brings new converging evidence for the Control Failure Concerns model and hopefully opens the door to future areas of research. These results can inform neuroscientific investigations of constructs like psychopathology, deficient attention control, mind-wandering, and the relationships among them, tying together the fields of clinical psychology, cognitive psychology, affective neuroscience, and cognitive neuroscience to give us a more complete understanding of the human cognitive and emotional systems, as well as the complex ways in which they interact.",4,36,29.63888888888889,0,0.5243178849640702,0.4336808725208458,0.537349887264387,0.5179938894012256,0.1388888888888889,0.4061736848453681,0.38397362730657814,0.39747893866286893,0.39335662433889274,0.23296578804651896,0.1961363513542241,0.21076560937918914,0.20470168745981474,0.16054581285070385,1.3684202393250553,0.2720796739903962,0.15945174879476323,1.3552035333608339,0.271443190178581,0.16310855285149442,1.3613480431376497,0.27386884561601194,0.15902389810550657,1.3568198916910397,0.2711783576509724,0.021634615384615384,0.026485147194529345,0.05333333333333334,0.021052631578947368,2.882603998261518,3.379880352545264,0,0,1.0675068038579067,6.721638013424337,8.660341430799038,-0.8189859542883079,1.6391136496126804,0.6448769381787549,,-0.216934245120723,0.31596886430471954,1.5450224697456245,1.5969389259896047,0.1318135196802958,0.010426707537704463,-0.10166514687246571,0.5659341270184812,0.4376337005687106,-0.1823397520791021,-0.695855847328679,0.34280491876343594,-0.30989131228317934,0.6967220053597082,0.7847182413749304,0.7242697188892264,0.41843514237304164,0.5332582127762372,0.48536673485865894,0.23662865270989775,0.18610545615980817,0.1686591688197974,-0.07838597846288567,0.14936329146899371,0.008269982054083871,-0.34103284694133273,-0.2348771366500077,0.4254897692778812,-0.7250465190006866,-1.9174398644859827,-1.428638370052988,,,-1.717123486910172,1.1186246400213917,-0.5578246228336373,0,8.33868741655653
18,discussion_3.txt,"Participants in the current study outlined a range of approaches which underpin their applied work, and several of these can be seen to fall within the frameworks and models proposed by Hill (2001) and Poczwardowski and colleagues (2004). What remains unclear is how a practitioner should integrate different approaches in a complementary, considered, faithful manner. It seems that sport psychology could perhaps learn from other areas of psychology about how to truly integrate different approaches: First, there needs to be in-depth learning of the substance of two or more theoretical traditions, and second, there must be an orienting framework for theoretical and/or technical assimilation and accommodation (Boswell, 2016, p.5). Consideration must also be given to the philosophical underpinnings of MI, and how these may or may not be congruent with different action-orientated, directive, or instruction-based interventions which may be common in applied sport psychology. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that relational techniques from the MI approach can be used alongside content-based interventions, irrespective of theoretical stance (Hardcastle et al., 2017; Hardcastle, 2016).
This study investigated the level of understanding and use of MI with applied sport psychologists who are not experts in the MI approach, and identified some explicit understanding and use, and much implicit use of MI. It is now pertinent for future research to investigate this area with practitioners who are experts in MI and are working in sport. This will begin the process of identifying best practice around applying MI in sport as part of an integrated approach, and as an intervention in its own right, which might then inform the training curricula of students and neophyte practitioners in this discipline. Participants in the current study cited a lack of research on this approach in this domain, and a lack of sport-specific examples for practitioners, as barriers to learning and using MI in sport psychology. As such, it will be important for future research to fill these knowledge gaps. Based on existing literature highlighting the important role of relationships between practitioner and athletes (e.g., Sharp et al., 2015), one avenue for future research could be in the development of a sport-specific measure of the therapeutic alliance, as an ongoing assessment of the strength of the consultancy relationship from the perspective of the client. Another avenue worthy of exploration would be adaptions to MI for working with different sporting populations, including groups (teams) and adolescents. Finally, an exploration of integrating MI with different action-orientated approaches in sport psychology (e.g., rational emotive behavior therapy (Wood, Barker, & Turner, 2017); solution focused therapy (Hoigaard & Johansen, 2004)) may further enhance professional practice.
Although this study has generated novel information about the role of MI in applied sport psychology, there are some limitations which must be acknowledged. The practitioners sampled are well established in the discipline and are currently working at the elite level. Therefore, their experiences are perhaps not representative of those who are just beginning their careers, regarding the level of athlete that they work with, and the nature of the work itself. At the elite level, practitioners are perhaps less likely to encounter disengagement and resistance, for example. When neophytes are beginning the training process, they may experience increased levels of ambivalence or disengagement, given that they are unlikely to be working with elite athletes. In addition, the participants sampled in the current study are working primarily with athletes individually. Again this is perhaps not representative of the neophytes experience, where they are potentially delivering workshops and seminars to teams or groups of athletes and coaches. Both of these examples support the need to explore MI in sport psychology when working with resistant athletes and for adaptations for working with teams.
This study has begun the process of exploring the application of MI in sport psychology, and identified the need to clarify the system of integrating different approaches. It is proposed here that this counseling approach can underpin the delivery of sport psychologys dominant action-orientated interventions, and enhance the practitioner-athlete relationship. Discrepancy between responses related to explicit and implicit use of MI indicates that the MI approach has more to offer applied sport psychologyto the training curricula for students of the discipline, and ongoing professional development of neophyte practitioners and established practitioners alike.",4,26,31.384615384615383,0,0.5190915995836258,0.4605612597331548,0.5349527343442397,0.5274576780031479,0.0,0.3588218766044041,0.34137865228491954,0.3660246688999339,0.3478856389734657,0.23592491501844243,0.23200630229883157,0.24206952571454976,0.23951002616820494,0.18092100821621254,1.4657475682863035,0.29704716157888506,0.16867487112378993,1.4086251460273813,0.28323060439724423,0.1666030541931395,1.4112300453513509,0.28256591515507845,0.17002778820378023,1.4148124228027377,0.2847264403220097,0.03944444444444444,0.04152907224989605,0.013157894736842105,0.03691045796308954,2.93007203544136,3.3801193220654366,0,0,1.168516451021098,6.484740724819721,8.846442297790691,-0.8189859542883079,0.356552108444699,1.0218784739204958,,-0.2555135661885194,0.5364687842271841,1.5276117276237087,1.670487256000897,-0.6381081815864973,-1.0563232027424783,-1.4988777777033828,0.3231064956294753,-0.412058127214172,-0.09724885276612144,0.7938764216691323,0.7443799184006451,0.7353119891587926,1.1117823665668116,1.0280785022510592,1.0309290992829008,0.8814889714592711,0.8791109981121865,0.859647692325862,0.551096315957741,1.0932648968848224,0.8317591041825942,1.1247034848504713,1.2563181198878473,1.161508859506162,0.21877034744128201,0.2162846825044718,-0.6669941473414126,0.43314107909142985,-1.4908728457260094,-1.4260986916912022,,,0.38174602146561804,0.356605896487982,0.15097243751040018,0,3.029099013873788
19,discussion_4.txt,"In line with what was described in our study regarding the benefits of having technical tools that support daily life, it seems relevant to advocate for the availability of getting CGM advice in the early postpartum period. This would be to assist the mothers adjustment to rapid changes in blood glucose levels, and especially to avoid hypoglycaemic episodes, as they interfere with taking care of the baby, including the childs security. The womens heightened awareness of the need for control, together with a reassuring effect of early alarms in case of a trend towards hypoglycaemia, might support these women in taking command of their diabetes. Fallon and Dunne (2015) claim that fundamental needs for women with type 1 diabetes are those related to safety and security. Since professional support is not available 24 h a day, particularly during early motherhood, technical devices can assist in continuously monitoring the unfamiliar and unpredictable blood glucose levels. This could be time and energy saving and might decrease the burden of daily self-management, potentially leading to better wellbeing and less exhaustion for these women. This is in line with what was found in a previous study by our research group (Berg & Sparud-Lundin, 2012; Berg et al., 2012).
Beyond technical devices for diabetes management, healthcare providers and peers could play a crucial role in supporting these women during early motherhood. The form of antenatal care provider has been found to influence the intention to breastfeed in women with diabetes (Finkelstein et al., 2013). For women in our study the frequent contacts with the antenatal care providers during pregnancy were abruptly interrupted when the child was born. Other healthcare professionals, either during the early postpartum care or after discharge, did not replace their supportive role. During a period of experiencing a more unfamiliar diabetes than ever before, and with reformulated incentives for taking care of themselves simultaneously with caring for the baby, most of the women in our study felt left with the responsibility. As the healthcare system did not support them sufficiently during early motherhood, they searched for support from other women in similar conditions. This is in line with the findings of Edwards et al. (2016), who made an extensive qualitative exploration of 200 electronic interactions between women with type 1 diabetes, from planning pregnancy, throughout pregnancy, and into early motherhood. The communication was retrieved from a free Internet-based counselling service and psychosocial support provided by a non-profit organization mainly for people with diabetes. Diabetes-specific distress was most frequent during contemplation, for example, when considering pregnancy, followed closely by the phase of motherhood. Depressed mood peaked during motherhood, and partners were not always able to understand their experiences. The authors conclude that contacts with other women who have experiences of pregnancy and motherhood seem to offer assurance not provided by their healthcare providers (Edwards et al., 2016). Although healthcare providers can assist in advising on how to make adjustments in insulin doses and so forth in order to balance the juggling of blood glucose, peers with diabetes are more likely to help prioritize the dual role in early motherhood.
Although the findings in this study resonate with other research, and by that demonstrate transferability, some limitations need to be acknowledged. First, the question of selection bias is always present in research studies. However, the effort to achieve a INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE STUDIES ON HEALTH AND WELL-BEING 7 varied sample of women with type 1 diabetes with respect to experiences both of being a first-time mother and of having given birth earlier increases external validity. Second, socioeconomic differences regarding educational levels, social welfare systems (for paid parental leave) and healthcare systems, as well as varying sociocultural attitudes towards breastfeeding, can have an impact on the transferability of the findings to other societies.
Having diabetes and being in the early period after giving birth to a child is demanding and challenging. The healthcare system needs to support these women, especially first-time mothers. After the extraordinary health care provided during pregnancy, it would be highly relevant and important to at least phase out the frequent support more gradually after the childbirth, not least because of the new challenges faced in relation to diabetes management in early motherhood. Therefore, we propose that a woman with type 1 diabetes should have planned and frequent contacts with her diabetes nurse directly after childbirth, preferably arranged beforehand. To secure the diabetes management support, telephone follow-up once or twice a week could be relevant during this extra-demanding period, as well as accessibility to technical support for facilitating daily self-management, if wanted. Moreover, providing these women with alternative sources for health information and peer support beyond the antenatal and diabetes care has the potential to improve their life situation during motherhood. This needs to be further investigated in upcoming studies.",4,34,26.852941176470587,0,0.40171803830360825,0.35059982095087616,0.3880604372659166,0.37073397080641285,0.08823529411764706,0.3590489395788782,0.3591886650486223,0.3667114363714705,0.33856509494603115,0.21589661192237622,0.20869328223262765,0.20344731489013113,0.21793305985479852,0.16112494256492693,1.3823018639042364,0.2735902147353144,0.16147383506296292,1.374284294770015,0.2742460685421984,0.15757282962061292,1.3578205183401584,0.26861423259645156,0.16020344847998527,1.3668205925008587,0.2718986379082413,0.01961904761904762,0.03949420677361854,0.047619047619047616,0.038375350140056025,3.031351305378979,3.4679692374149864,0,0,1.2371613422697014,6.890069553478559,9.234457134961206,-0.8189859542883079,1.382601341379084,0.043232540474406014,,-1.1219400959061678,-0.36554532198883555,0.4607194644595526,0.45250073682217795,-0.14898145372288754,-1.0512078878971498,-0.914668612747841,0.32840835511262784,-0.5862261164705295,-0.6731708521690274,-0.1743478821234733,0.2489238824322478,0.08741216794616491,0.7085193787865224,0.8194282844330222,0.7428227065398378,0.5199555121382512,0.6567875139391788,0.5743653886887612,-0.26152710074664504,0.121953511963052,-0.23197388786391157,0.05057792560275781,0.34025552943114235,0.0695816241153934,-0.40438669889965656,0.1552598098975384,0.2701021629215498,0.5401305182999059,-0.5807362821306851,-0.4924627663359859,,,1.8081114548058195,1.6604121432871224,1.6287934729635338,0,-2.066217417432828
20,discussion_5.txt,"Third, at Adams, and at almost all positive outlier schools in LSES-III, there was a prominent display of the names of academic honor roll students in a heavily traveled hall near the principal's office. Academic excellence was the single most important goal of the school. Of central interest in LSES-III, the school's commitment to academics had been translated into in-class action. The rate of interactive instructing at Adams nearly doubled that at Fillmore. Similarly, time spent in organizing and off-task activities was a third lower at Adams.
If a rational, data based school improvement literature is to develop, it will require information from both the school-effectiveness and teacher-effectiveness literatures. Good and Brophy (1986) have argued for research which nests classroom interaction studies within larger school effectiveness studies. Such research can provide a bridge between the school effectiveness and more devel oped teacher effectiveness literatures. LSES-III is one such study. We are just beginning the analysis of data from this phase, yet the first preliminary analyses presented here indicate that the method offers promise. If further analyses confirm our findings in the 16 school database, and if other studies replicate.
LSES-III findings, then connections will have been built between the ""process"" of the two fields, and substantial progress will have been made toward the development of a more unified model of effective schooling.
Given that practice cannot wait on theory development, practical issues should be addressed. To date, the quasi-experimental teacher effectiveness literature is much more developed than similar efforts in the school effectiveness field. The preliminary findings of LSES-III suggest that school ""culture"" and other school level variables are translated in effective schools into specific, measurable teacher behaviors. In several studies (e.g., Anderson, Evertson, and Brophy, 1979; Good and Grouws, 1979; Stallings, 1980) these teacher behaviors have proven alterable through extensive, specific, behaviorally based workshops series. Future school improvement studies might find added strength in in-depth efforts to change patterns of classroom interaction.",4,17,23.352941176470587,0,0.48325808346271515,0.34945214594549995,0.32240157965570687,0.29479106043775877,0.29411764705882354,0.37976139245761764,0.3682146726457018,0.37358314461413433,0.5001619764885894,0.20226107758504372,0.20577172182559494,0.19134574640316493,0.25342086110019474,0.12842765930468905,1.1275457602463606,0.22588612176417397,0.1526131326287612,1.3161208343055941,0.26078650965511285,0.14635714004085812,1.2751763642007612,0.25827758117771893,0.14870792304616212,1.2824530060248758,0.25796202855004574,0.022727272727272728,0.25757575757575757,0.07407407407407407,0.023809523809523808,3.0333894400686225,3.4295612408442477,0,0,1.084204335131937,6.735099793189645,8.661683160220754,-0.8189859542883079,-0.7977532786064844,-0.7126163157617902,,-0.520028919404676,-0.374959704482053,-0.01616685691901842,-0.1376935784520678,0.9923142446255352,-0.5845940864211698,-0.6185949135802102,0.38145808886065613,2.433447825900408,-1.0652661864974726,-0.29568461940823143,0.09368172970282546,1.153017950897938,0.042447424283499305,0.18242825055094924,0.15690441816881473,0.07509724785631502,0.28023589368092494,0.14698950336792804,-1.2708189421394736,-1.3810219365183416,-1.0200822106547927,-1.2062635551071488,-1.2701433516205605,-1.1167293928739228,-0.3066881562241793,6.695445886457647,0.9894892293860462,-0.5236949394473158,-0.5624207778451661,-0.9006485372235312,,,-1.37016712936946,1.161926648933804,-0.5527144162813378,0,5.9520226006655506
21,discussion_6.txt,"It is acknowledged that the small sample size limits its generalizability. The study aimed to gather similar numbers of both male and female athletes to ensure both populations were represented. However, gaining an equal number of participants depending on type of sport (e.g., individual vs team, closed vs open skills) was not a priority. In this study, one athlete participated in a team sport and there was evidence that counterfactuals would be influenced by contextual factors such as being part of a group. For example, a team athlete might experience more counterfactuals directed at others behaviors that influence outcome. This might be seen as less controllable and might influence the consequences associated with the counterfactuals experienced. Future research might aim to explore these differences and the possible gender differences in the generation and experience of counterfactuals and their perceived consequences regarding elite athletes.
In using semistructured interviews to explore athletes counterfactuals, it is plausible that memory decay and poor reconstructive processes may have influenced participants responses (Brewer, Van Raalte, Linder, & Van Raalte 1991; Smith, Leffingwell, & Ptacek, 1999). Reporting on significant past events or capturing in the moment counterfactual thoughts, think out load protocols could be applied in future (Nicholls & Polman, 2008). However, both think out loud and semistructured interview protocols are researcher prompted. Alternative methods such as archival methods might be used to capture self-generated counterfactuals.
Despite the limitations, the use of currently competing elite athletes provided ecologically validity to the representation of counterfactuals experienced and their perceived consequences. Findings from this study could be of value for those in the applied settings working with both elite athletes and less experienced athletes. Upward counterfactuals present themselves when performance does not reach a certain level set by expectations or goals. It is therefore important to monitor each athletes expectations and ensure the athletes goals are flexible to alleviate negative emotional consequences that could be debilitative to performance or motivation. This may be shaped by the cultural environment and their goals. Goals around process and development may lead to an assimilation effect where motivation and performance can be enhanced. In relation to the REM (Markman & McMullen, 2003), upward counterfactual thoughts would be best used in a reflective process following an event to inform goals and intention for future practice and competitive behavior change. These could also be useful for significant others (e.g., coaches, physiotherapist, support staff) to inform how they might deal with issues brought up by the athlete that they might influence. For example, if there is conflict between two athletes then a coach might use each athletes counterfactuals using reflective practice to come up with a management strategy to overcome the issue. In addition, counterfactuals could be used to gain perspective on these goals and protect an athletes self-esteem following failure (McCrea, 2008). Beyond the scope of elite athletes, individuals who participate in performance related activities (e.g., business, sport & exercise practitioners, health services) would benefit from lessons learned from elite athletes to understand and suitably use counterfactuals to facilitate cognitive, emotional and behavioral change to enhance their practice.
This study taps into the experiences elite athletes have of counterfactuals. It also provides an insight into how elite athletes cope with the negatives effects of counterfactuals as well as use the positive effects of counterfactuals to improve and sustain high performance. Future research on elite athletes counterfactual thoughts using experimental and longitudinal studies would be beneficial to investigate the antecedents and consequences of counterfactual thinking on training and performance. The use of an elite population could be a useful source for understanding high performance athletes and how they experience thoughts, emotions and behaviors. By understanding how elite athletes generate, experience and reflect on counterfactuals, it is hoped other athletes can use counterfactuals to identify causal inferences and deploy accompanying changes to enhance both performance and motivation to succeed making sport more fulfilling and enjoyable.",4,27,26.88888888888889,0,0.5744251012802124,0.4716548443774552,0.5377430806557337,0.5289658009360879,0.037037037037037035,0.4167240566128622,0.38990755943392497,0.40218356939928,0.3924112272971634,0.2378987030774031,0.2292216536772924,0.2184575239673329,0.23630306982371868,0.17721757200152702,1.4522869771955806,0.2918330257945996,0.17572032168783386,1.4525150851810469,0.2916817492269532,0.17686872428627087,1.4588028739498717,0.29361897915352325,0.17614137954650377,1.45711836278801,0.2927438003675821,0.057789855072463765,0.048238070606491656,0.021739130434782608,0.035530621785881254,2.9041320849067316,3.3700521555825924,0,0,1.1495128095418794,5.891584793892379,8.166686728660357,-0.8189859542883079,0.4848082625614971,0.05099569399317216,,0.1529465105891045,0.6274695018284986,1.5478782695084357,1.682207712557475,-0.4327957279153525,0.24810734856253003,0.09298140274064227,0.6022539763391865,0.4199675749303092,-0.04049177455226703,0.6782258339185839,0.4414788535149833,0.6390154842632755,1.0363401661167024,0.9944212243379924,0.966887267150994,1.2352111432937367,1.1632555034319583,1.1279934482211016,1.4748965867971167,1.9584294586490925,1.6744896342774798,1.7931214044903971,2.0638490836130874,1.8439619802603398,0.7954080814322314,0.4174850934428595,-0.4336460542719793,0.3323637651564267,-1.7239797535262036,-1.533088758301021,,,-0.013128772863650901,-1.5513768409549502,-2.4379931967747877,0,7.617975836812358
22,discussion_7.txt,"Many Hindu populations, particularly in lower-income communities, attribute mental illness to karma (destiny) and choose not to seek professional help as they have accepted their condition as fate, or that nazar (the evil eye) causes cognitive dysfunction through supernatural causes (Juthani 2001; Betty 2005). Both patients and caregivers in these communities tend to seek treatments that align with their own beliefs, for example, spiritual healers, instead of visiting medical doctors (Dwyer 2003). Given Indias high rate of mental health issues coupled with its dearth of mental health providers, low-income Hindu communities stand to be even more impacted by mental health issues. However, given the significant emphasis on the communitys well-being over an individuals, this concept was utilized to link the positive psychology intervention with Hinduism: the teachers were from the community and the positive psychology interventions were taught in the community. Thus, a fundamental difference between these two perspectives (community by Hinduism and individual by positive psychology) was able to be utilized in an approach that sought to improve the well-being of the communitys youth overall.
As highlighted above, one unique approach taken by the Hero Lab intervention was to implement the initiative in front of the childrens homes, as opposed to in a school or building away from the community. This meant the curriculum was taught in the presence of family. This was crucial to the success of the curriculum because youth were learning to identify their signature strengths and build resilience, gratitude, hope, and purpose with their daily reality in the backdrop, not away from it. Students who graduated into the Stage 2 curriculum, equipped with the strengths, values and mindsets to contribute to their own happiness and their communitys happiness, are currently using design thinking to launch and lead three major projects: an English and storytelling program for local youth, a community cleanup campaign, and art classes for kids in the neighborhood to have a medium for self-expression. The success of the youth-organized capstone project and the ideas now being launched in the Stage 2 program are testaments to how teaching at-risk communities to not just learn, but to apply positive psychology, can reinforce teachings and contribute to greater social capital, neighbourhood cohesion, and deeper connections between self and community.
There are several limitations to this study. First, the skills and mindsets cultivated in the program need to be realized and applied over longer periods of time, and there is always a possibility given the volatile environments of these communities that strengths and values can be undone if they are not reinforced. However, this was taken into account by designing three stages of curricula for youth, such that once they finish one curriculum, they graduate into the next to continue building, but more importantly applying these softskills for well-being. The Stage 2 curriculum continues teaching positive psychology through design thinking and the Stage 3 curriculum focuses on building resilience in an entrepreneurial capacity by training local-level changemakers to launch their own social ventures. Second, this was a small sample size, and not a true representation of all the demographics and cultures of India. Thus, it would be useful in determining whether this curriculum can be implemented with the same success across slum communities with different types of adverse childhood experiences and diverse racial, religious, and economic makeups. To explore this, the Stage 1 curriculum is currently being taught in three other slums in Mumbai with a population ranging from 500 people to 700,000. A third limitation is understanding how this intervention translates into mental health outcomes in adulthood, which ongoing studies will explore. Fourth, it is unclear what part of the curriculum had the most impact on the participants, especially since it was implemented at the homes of the children. Regardless, the Hero Lab intervention as well as the location of the curriculum seemed to have played a significant role in improving specific elements of mental health in the participants. Finally, this was a small study (n = 50) and therefore needs a larger number of participants and greater community involvement in order to achieve substantial results, especially results that are sustained over time.
To date, positive psychology research has focused extensively on upper-middle class populations in developed economies. Though this trend is slowly shifting with non-profits and independent educators pioneering interventions in low-income schools and populations, there is a real and significant need for a more robust exploration in these settings. The intervention in Worli, Mumbai shows how positive psychology can be a low-cost, powerful tool to build the strengths, subjective values, and strong sense of meaning and purpose required to promote well-being and shield at-risk youth from depression. This study also reveals that when a positive psychology intervention is ingrained in community life, there is more buy-in from locals, and teachings can be applied directly to social impact and community upliftment. Further, long-term studies should explore how faith and positive psychology interventions correlate with reduced incidents of mental illness in low-income settings on at-risk children",4,26,36.92307692307692,0,0.5186006134748459,0.4057076033147482,0.5078163854777813,0.5036096109585328,0.07692307692307693,0.41904323965638546,0.39279638632472424,0.3921297406462283,0.3936623570655451,0.20271079422353389,0.20047095961496322,0.2115541242196989,0.20668343232082056,0.16154850286833597,1.3676028614592985,0.27104920364668883,0.15891501092158708,1.3511585952580192,0.2683636185823413,0.15926586904249163,1.3615623022653873,0.27060737165447196,0.16054248930624324,1.3641268631144798,0.27082877838231784,0.035075113378684804,0.030795906879498208,0.04395604395604396,0.030817009077878644,2.9912729399158553,3.4401520116533817,0,0,1.0909645415580134,6.349618507111089,8.729066742262663,-0.8189859542883079,0.356552108444699,2.217946993678872,,-0.2591379206490176,0.0865040291743096,1.3305179301136123,1.485150750832925,-0.2116900085771965,0.30035431431750403,0.18774153390767281,0.524638204588826,0.4433467634644137,-1.0523344016946512,-0.5158331366910355,0.3529201977400143,-0.250384701275637,0.7171476686935505,0.78267444450135,0.7116131231466479,0.3914878116835609,0.5070711877213759,0.3875823536324174,-0.10917170043821686,0.19000199563021714,-0.08000886394342335,0.08764631160635879,0.28883792972398964,-0.021486878245091434,0.08143239323011922,-0.10559902776215824,0.17049472294954277,-0.011898282388580376,-0.9408967161424239,-0.7880938003718528,,,-1.2296974659610305,-0.07803674196631795,-0.2960724906480805,0,3.1997309064176647
23,discussion_8.txt,"By reflecting on the research methods that have been used in collaboration with the Oxford House organization, the present article outlines the many ways to empirically evaluate and investigate recovery residences. Until recently, research on substance abuse has largely focused on formal treatment and the genetics and neuroscience of addiction. Although studying these individual factors is important for addiction research, investigating environmental factors and how they interact with individuals is equally fundamental for recovery research. In fact, the Obama administration, through the National Drug Control Strategy (2013), has emphasized the importance of working with stakeholders to develop services that support sustained recovery, such as recovery residences and other peer support services that can be provided by individuals who themselves are in recovery. Further research on the role of housing and recovery residences in substance abuse will enable policy makers and practitioners to better understand the legitimacy and importance of recovery residences and mutually supportive recovery organizations (Jason et al., 2013).
This article has several limitations. Current or former members of the DePaul University research team conducted all of the studies included in this article, because other research teams have not yet conducted empirical evaluations of Oxford House. Although there are strengths associated with having a pluralistic research program, there are also many benefits associated with having findings replicated by other research teams. Thus, as with all scientific endeavors, it is of importance for other research teams to replicate the findings summarized in this article. Another limitation may be that the researchers conducting the current review are also associated with the aforementioned research team. As demonstrated in research on psychotherapy, researcher allegiance may introduce a source of bias in treatment outcome evaluations. However, the aims of the current review were not focused on evaluating the effectiveness of Oxford House as a treatment, but rather evaluating the research processes that have contributed to existing knowledge on Oxford Houses in hopes of stimulating further research on recovery residences.
There are certainly more questions about recovery residences that need to be examined. For example, there is a need for more studies evaluating the effectiveness of Oxford House versus other types of recovery homes. Recovery residences have been classified into Levels of Support by the National Association of Recovery Residences based on the intensity and duration of support that are offered to the residents (Jason et al., 2013), where a Level 1 classification reflects minimal structure and supervision (such as an Oxford House) and a Level 4 classification reflects a highly structured and staffed program.
There is a need for research that examines how many recovery residences exist in the United States, the geographic distributions of these residences, the factors that promote sustainability of these residences, the physical and social characteristics of residences, their long-term effects for residents, and the neighborhoods effects on the residence and vice versa. Additionally, research is needed on which level of support is most appropriate for specific individuals. There is also a need for comparisons of long-term residential treatment programs, shelters, safe havens, transitional housing, incarceration, and homelessness programs. We hope that the quantitative and qualitative study designs and data analysis techniques delineated here can provide a framework for researchers to answer these critical questions in future research with recovery residences.",4,21,28.714285714285715,0,0.48903274200856683,0.37755426108681905,0.47018288758893806,0.44520710516898404,0.09523809523809523,0.3887147233593014,0.379177060276322,0.35137827975586766,0.37713458357879126,0.2867712534542354,0.2474977808433717,0.2509882824584132,0.25263008747873056,0.16653923790435674,1.3923332170105018,0.2819801665302267,0.1630928888090419,1.36057324089836,0.27479254699240907,0.1805272382279967,1.4125220950938329,0.2969319869692112,0.16358785188504288,1.3620355832833217,0.27595800029039547,0.0071428571428571435,0.022112573099415205,0.05660377358490566,0.020964360587002098,2.9291555062272323,3.352344391126476,0,0,1.1315999278499278,6.709914018508516,8.773173938577447,-0.8189859542883079,-0.2847286621392917,0.4452025804655649,,-0.4774016248962454,-0.1444379456483392,1.057182373845451,1.0312726106953019,-0.11016187214641064,-0.3828918644600363,-0.25900351920143927,0.21003606000784766,0.13450115674881719,1.3648582840092516,1.4372605042938165,0.8587921120000649,1.1292730888758857,0.8188132600942741,0.8445109897218248,0.8458710172616098,0.6012413294431805,0.5680218265197019,0.5917174960963548,1.804123626003968,1.1167622520382392,1.92708681756675,0.42060525592528153,0.24891981850693246,0.4151223644870507,-0.7965415735385498,-0.36600903712671884,0.5144222987019449,-0.7314934535089704,-1.4991091486722565,-1.721280232227616,,,-0.3853387770193803,1.0809124993397963,-0.12808267096960457,0,6.010040612489067
24,discussion_9.txt,"The present study has limitations that, if addressed, could strengthen the findings. First, there were time constraints for the intervention, which meant that participants were not fully exposed to all elements of REBT. Specifically, participants were not set behavioral homework assignments, such as flooding, and were not taught emotional strategies, such as rational-emotive imagery, in the REBT education workshops. Behavioral and emotional assignments REBT are considered to an important part of REBT, but it is necessary to monitor homework completion. But the group-level nature of the REBT intervention in the current study was logistically prohibitive with regards to setting and reviewing homework, as it would not have been possible within the time limits to review each participants homework as would be typical in one-to-one REBT. Therefore, without the scope to properly monitor and regulate homework adherence, and as is typical in group-level REBT (Turner et al., 2014; 2015), the assignment of homework was omitted in the current study. Nonetheless, the omission of homework could affect the quality of the REPDMS session. Researchers in sport should start to apply more comprehensive REBT programs, as short programs have been found to yield short-term benefits (e.g., Turner et al., 2014). Second, although participants volunteered for the study, their participation was not a result of a needs analysis. The effects of the intervention could be maximized by ensuring that participants present with high irrational beliefs at baseline, by screening athlete populations as part of the sampling process. In practice, REBT may be best applied to athletes who have high irrational beliefs to reduce the cost and time commitment for sports organizations, and ensures that all participants experience maximum benefits. However, away from a research paradigm, practitioners should be aware that REBT is not just a remedial approach to applied work, and can be used with any athlete who wishes to strengthen their current rational beliefs and learn to challenge and dispute their irrational beliefs.
Another possible limitation may have been that some participants were at different periods in their season. Some participants, such as the tennis players, had important competitions coming up after the REPDMS, while for others the season was almost over. Athletes who had no more competitions for this season may have engaged less in the program. But those who were still competing may have been highly engaged as there performance relevant emotions would have been more salient. Indeed, psychological and emotional states may change in the lead-up to competition, with for example increased somatic state anxiety intensity as the event draw nearer, and a stabilization in cognitive state anxiety (e.g., Cerin, Szabo, Hunt, & Williams, 2000; Mabweazara, Andrews, & Leach, 2014). In addition, participants were involved in various sports and it may be more ecologically valid to study athletes from the same team, such as in previous research (Turner et al., 2015), where similar activating events and irrational may be expressed. Future researchers should use a more homogenous sample of athletes from the same team at the same period of their competitive season. For example, Turner et al. (2015) completed a between-groups REBT program within the same cohort of athletes, including a control group, finding reductions in irrational beliefs for the REBT group and not for the control group. Finally, given that PDMS is in essence a team building intervention, future research should include measures of group dynamics (e.g., cohesion) as is typical in past research (Carron & Spink, 1993; Dunn & Holt, 2004; Holt & Dunn, 2006; Paradis & Martin, 2012), alongside markers of individual belief change.
It should also be recognized that social validation data were not collected in the current study, which deviates from past singe-case research (e.g., Turner et al., 2015). Social validation would have helped to interpret the data presented (e.g., Page & Thelwell, 2013), and may have reduced speculation as to the mechanisms of change in irrational and rational beliefs found in the current study. In PDMS research, qualitative data from participants regarding the process is potential important (Dunn & Holt, 2004), and inclusion of social validation in the current study may have aided the future administration of REPDMS. Future researchers should consider using social validation interviews (e.g., Page & Thelwell, 2013) with participants to provide a greater understanding of perceived intervention effects.
To conclude, the current study is the first published study to examine and support the use of REPDMS to reduce irrational beliefs and stabilize elevated rational beliefs in athletes. Indeed, no other published study has documented the use of REPDMS, thus giving the current study novelty within REBT and sport and exercise literatures. The present study is also the first published study to report the use of REBT with Greek athletes, thus extending the understanding of how REBT can be applied cross-culturally. This study contributes to the growing research concerning the use of REBT in sport settings, and especially contributes to the work reported within group contexts. The findings that REPDMS is able to reduce irrational beliefs and stabilize elevated rational beliefs compared with REBT education has clear implications for the provision of REBT in sport. The notion that sharing the REBT process in a PDMS session can enhance the effects of REBT may provide practitioners with a valuable tool for use in group-settings, and is a promising area for further study. It is hoped that the current study encourages other practitioners to apply REBT in their practice, and importantly, to report athlete experiences of REBT in literature.",4,37,28.83783783783784,0,0.4678506070954932,0.33442095316108,0.4200739330850924,0.41013196468569746,0.05405405405405406,0.3829796163267211,0.3683535645678108,0.36771567557068247,0.3647621416493408,0.20654539946270617,0.20026233937180798,0.20488635822090706,0.2114116832335135,0.17055726402104468,1.4193205508225581,0.28575512115866286,0.16417144423963853,1.3823426854291796,0.2767574140473589,0.1635295347898885,1.3779677453754586,0.2761854701256589,0.16078372588762693,1.3673786501360785,0.2723601472946067,0.025321565407772303,0.021415615317745135,0.031578947368421054,0.01929824561403509,2.927468667639562,3.3732852173323447,0,0,1.1413852497520747,6.392689579621727,8.494961850771068,-0.8189859542883079,1.7673698037294785,0.4718845036862579,,-0.633763615148559,-0.4982606368356619,0.6932364288317909,0.7586843148268592,-0.33846297893131294,-0.5120933699510064,-0.6140389407737361,0.3361611030839059,-0.09669600585249115,-0.9420687688214038,-0.5244974448378313,0.2673843146300397,-0.10840770244801237,0.9006639290775621,0.9119909531293089,0.8922363250751277,0.6553910202098016,0.7089577258755648,0.6541071185343262,0.2745125146671546,0.48835314306051325,0.3452880385449973,0.11402145590864454,0.3509076700085678,0.10886619150317815,-0.22514367172472854,-0.3869105465064114,-0.166073574219029,-0.8531793423528315,-1.5142677638209225,-1.4987289915733009,,,-0.18201053712486326,0.06050838343599026,-1.1877011089545442,0,5.787769993749695
25,editorials_1.txt,"Stephen Hawking, one of the greatest scientists of the modern age, died this week at 76. The pioneering astrophysicist spent his life changing the way we think about the universe, but some people say his obituaries show how much work remains in changing how we think about people with disabilities.
Social media users decried some coverage of Hawking's death as ""ableist,"" a term to describe discrimination or prejudice against people who are disabled. Hawking, who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 21, used a wheelchair and communicated through a computerized voice system. While the media described his remarkable scientific achievements, many also fixated on his ALS, something advocates say perpetuates stereotypes about people living with disabilities.
""There are people who think he's a hero because he lived with this degenerative motor neuron disability. Well, no. The alternative to that was dying,"" said Colleen Kelly Starkloff, co-founder of the Starkloff Disability Institute, which works to change attitudes about people with disabilities. Starkloff and her late husband Max Starkloff, who was disabled, met Hawking at a White House reception in 1998. ""He wanted to live. He wanted to make a contribution. He was a curious man, and he did a great deal to help us think differently about the universe. ... His pictures will draw attention to his disability. What should be focused on primarily was that this man was a genius and that he advanced physics in a way that most people have not.""
Many stories about Hawking's death used phrases such as ""overcame his disability,"" or ""in spite of his disability,"" which Starkloff said have negative connotations. As one Twitter user wrote, ""We really need to stop referring to disability and success/achievement as if they're somehow diametrically opposed.""
People also took issue with cartoons depicting Hawking standing in heaven a place he did not believe in for implying he was now finally ""free.""
Hawking's accomplishments were extraordinary for anyone, able-bodied or not, and yet in a headline recapping his life Buzzfeed wrote ""Stephen Hawking, Astrophysicist With A Paralyzing Disease, Dies At 76.""
From the Washington Post's obit: ""Stephen W. Hawking, the British theoretical physicist who overcame a devastating neurological disease to probe the greatest mysteries of the cosmos and become a globally celebrated symbol of the power of the human mind, died March 14 at his home in Cambridge, England.""
From CNN's obit: ""Stephen Hawking, the brilliant British theoretical physicist who overcame a debilitating disease to publish wildly popular books probing the mysteries of the universe, has died, according to a family spokesman.""
From USA TODAY's obit, which has since been corrected: ""Despite his physical ailments, he was known for a direct and dry wit, often combining the marvelous and mundane in his observations.""",9,21,26.238095238095237,0,0.5526352901011705,0.42326396598281074,0.199570606669618,0.20095301491932738,0.047619047619047616,0.3946662623943253,0.3684201619148925,0.31936823757779265,0.3666485388778872,0.21733882786198097,0.18917158100823944,0.17774730896603108,0.180730027601443,0.12190843486809969,0.9970564973597507,0.20198779632909955,0.1520134957661274,1.3038661188077767,0.26084432507793814,0.1593104129075558,1.3532164928900359,0.27481000885579654,0.15882330857437546,1.3437905770755376,0.2692418353454298,0.015625,0.011588103254769921,0.0,0.025780189959294438,3.1350746973754267,3.609080532505094,0,0,1.1354268952592124,6.0551426800229065,8.874058408235124,0.3645197600011544,-0.2847286621392917,-0.08954763074915938,,-0.007901215910561754,0.23051893981759292,-0.9082995103141045,-0.8669608761178639,-0.374135026866454,-0.24881454054174104,-0.6118543954259559,-0.03708214624355166,-0.061445916236732685,-0.6316993463942296,-0.9851130907131237,-0.08076265771445035,-1.029697512599623,-0.09035481888033708,-0.14385113465917038,-0.13662314019653485,0.04499202585031689,0.20089857537728234,0.14882529291515204,-0.10516323004737087,0.038224211472590267,0.240417280062173,-0.10031705458229079,-0.09933878185211746,-0.15657052446121322,-0.5299286458856763,-0.6816340447807394,-1.0247945567145438,-0.379765939384187,0.35136415277809,1.0072151109313214,,,-0.3058185982000416,-1.0252662399502224,0.2561531291297887,0,-2.1985409314481323
26,editorials_11.txt,"When you want to work in the White House, its important to tell the truth.
I dont mean that from an ethical perspective, though of course its important to tell the truth for the good of society, too. Im talking about practicality. As the frenzied untangling of the Trump administrations histories shows, when you work in the White House, telling the truth can save you a lot of hassle, and the rest of the country a lot of worry. Working as Barack Obamas director of scheduling and advance in the weeks before the 2008 presidential election, I learned this through what I thought at the time was the hard way: by doing it.
Ive written before about my struggles with the SF86, the extensive form you must fill out if you need national security clearance. The form is the starting point for the FBIs interviews and background checks, which they use to evaluate a persons fitness to serve in high-stakes positions. Its no joke. Though my SF86-related panic attacks had mainly to do with my lifelong love of marijuana, these interviews are about a lot more than having done a bump of coke in a club in college.
Even the most junior potential staffers are expected to spill the details of everything they did since the age of 18 where they lived, their landlords, the contact information for their French cousins they visit every summer. My dorm at the University of Wisconsin had been torn down; to complete the form, I had to show the FBI on Google Earth where it had been and give contact information for people who could validate it had existed. I had to call my boss at a job I had when I was 26 and which I quit, badly, on the day they gave me my bonus. I had to ask if I could provide his phone number, email and address to the FBI. If part of your family lives in a remote village in Siberia, chances are you wont get your final clearance until the FBI has talked to them.
I mention the nitty-gritty, behind-the-scenes things we had to deal with not to be a martyr or because any of us felt the intensity of the questioning was unfair or inappropriate. I tell you this because it was a job to complete this form, and it was a job we all senior advisers and junior assistants alike took seriously. We knew that the security of the United States could be compromised if we screwed up the SF86. That was far more important than saving ourselves from an awkward conversation with an FBI agent; mine was about whether it was accurate to say Id smoked weed more than 500 times in my life.
Now, imagine were not talking about staffers. Imagine were talking about the president. Actually, never mind. No need to imagine. We are talking about the president. With every passing news cycle, the current administration is learning this lesson, about the importance of telling the truth, an even harder way. The total failure to follow protocol, to tell the truth about staffers backgrounds, is biting them in the ass.",6,25,23.84,0,0.3771355322290522,0.2484806018677773,0.20484377518813643,0.2283605460820365,0.16,0.35123656982822077,0.357412539430195,0.3899932360134975,0.37965246757737126,0.2508659573804055,0.23626272081579242,0.28573393812185227,0.2594828406761341,0.14912769272398185,1.237415934162377,0.26413416354725483,0.16088630767588658,1.3477838568571692,0.27647538429553853,0.15452757087788227,1.3254470339350872,0.2678646819469216,0.15791942085258442,1.338091529722424,0.2735433393288253,0.05080409356725146,0.042952907658790014,0.0,0.03618272274988693,3.1336438671505826,3.5903469712672216,0,0,1.1628231442886616,6.085280374075746,8.678248235756282,-0.345583668572523,0.22829595432790084,-0.6074326429948034,,-1.303402898923006,-1.2032296697818932,-0.8700000023979858,-0.6539618086682536,0.24884161827284834,-1.2272063352675253,-0.9729295965081813,0.5081443433951701,0.18155149972478837,0.33238689565409274,0.9706517962680109,1.3045186629836865,1.3350433304808589,0.4641250177437806,0.45715102854225104,0.6266801916783044,0.49045825550721617,0.4852230514062205,0.6451519428200102,-0.5355677455159363,-0.46679414658939017,-0.28912267631752386,-0.19914190510271865,-0.20812154859781987,0.20958177513845241,0.5758298029054815,0.25898498650685076,-1.0247945567145438,0.37999042160478735,0.3385061325264634,0.8081218538470487,,,0.26344536169561106,-0.9283234345242428,-0.4896234858963344,0,0.7145351752006787
27,editorials_13.txt,"With the news cycle in hyperdrive ever since the inauguration of President Donald Trump (and even before that), it feels as though most Americans have forgotten about one of the most horrifying examples of government malfeasance and environmental racism in recent memory: the Flint Water Crisis.
It was heartening to see the Michigan city get some attention as a result of Will and Jaden Smiths eco-friendly water company, which has vowed to donate water to the beleaguered, majority-black city. But it reminded me that what happened in Flint, an hour north of my hometown of Detroit, has largely faded from the public eye. I have friends in Flint, many of whom are still wary of drinking the tap water, even with the free filters provided by the state. When the cameras and celebrities left, thousands of poor, now-poisoned Flint residents, including infants and children, remained. And weve all but abandoned them.
On April 25, 2014, Flint officials made the cost-cutting decision to switch the citys main water supply from the Detroit system to the Flint River. Initially an effort to save $5 million, the decision proved to be more costly than they thought. And shortly after the switch, residents started to complain about discoloration in the water, a taste of urine and an odd smell. Rashes and hair loss were also a common complaint.
The river water was dangerously corrosive to the citys pipes, so much so that a General Motors plant stopped using it because it was eroding car parts. Over a year later, researchers found evidence of dangerously high levels of lead in the water, which finally prompted the city to take action.
While we wont see the long-term health effects on a city filled with lead-poisoned individuals for another 10 or 20 years, some side-effects of the contaminated water have already occurred. An outbreak of Legionnaires disease caused by the water crisis has killed a dozen people. A study discovered a horrifyingly large increase in fetal deaths and miscarriages in Flint in recent years.
Flint is one of Michigans poorest and blackest cities. People of color represent 57 percent of the population and were the primary victims of a system that failed them.
The Michigan Civil Rights Commission said in a report that officials whose decisions caused the crisis as well as those who reacted slowly to it may not have been racist, but that systemic racism was the real culprit. The report asked if the Flint water crisis would have been allowed to happen in affluent, largely white Michigan communities, such as Ann Arbor or Bloomfield Hills.",7,19,25.94736842105263,0,0.5008952890833219,0.34624545739375445,0.36519994622185115,0.3561354402607928,0.2631578947368421,0.3989972575671143,0.3906811689933231,0.3369468147252014,0.3504526465709898,0.25297540947794916,0.22721845203299743,0.2058170500504612,0.24352569332485702,0.1439992223710957,1.1996188173835067,0.24136773683386517,0.17878863223597005,1.4748081695579018,0.2981536903486293,0.17345133168593266,1.4442786030281591,0.29005480562838226,0.17560680210779805,1.4526395494184368,0.2930104327660908,0.010416666666666666,0.00837257980115123,0.022727272727272728,0.030303030303030304,3.222238195955903,3.6053311983212994,0,0,1.214937634790576,6.319344228836103,8.723848718087094,-0.10888252571463052,-0.541240970372888,-0.15233206850311495,,-0.38983483912690114,-0.40126418303332867,0.29468161555831096,0.33904749019839986,0.8206908313400579,-0.1512451153471241,0.11835756617712792,0.09862484311164701,-0.3640898379865715,0.39304504846088795,0.5950298982613506,0.27932347799578694,0.8558919629629764,0.3596536387496825,0.362641949768151,0.34705500772808306,1.3892579939647574,1.3075814595499526,1.3334943557786707,1.1673678837396102,1.6942895103400337,1.40274255630753,1.7346743936525852,1.978358004158617,1.8666582432973147,-0.6936383383041076,-0.7780664190134853,-0.4067756677973172,-0.049437086780285126,1.134650674470466,0.9673685945604802,,,1.34632722625941,-0.1754188928063334,-0.31594623039059067,0,-1.3929444669704738
28,editorials_15.txt,"To his most ardent supporters, Donald Trump is a kind of genius whose intuition takes him into policy realms where lesser leaders fear to tread. He takes willful pleasure in not reading briefing books or checking with experts, but in trusting his ample gut.
Exhibits A and B, which dominated the news last week, were his declaration of tariffs on aluminum and steel to the horror of every orthodox economist, and the joy of his base and his even more abrupt decision to accept the invitation of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for a face-to-face meeting.
Might either of these impulsive decisions produce policy breakthroughs, proving the conventional view of both substance and process wrong? Dont bet on it.
Take the case of Korea first.
Going back to the Clinton administration, the North Koreans have repeatedly tried to pull the United States into a process that would trade some kind of limits on their nuclear program for security guarantees and the lifting of economic sanctions. But after more than three decades of false starts under three generations of Kims, starting with the current leaders grandfather Kim Il Sung in 1994, North Koreas program of intercontinental missiles and nuclear weapons has only moved relentlessly forward. Given the logic of mutually assured destruction, Washington has lost leverage over Pyongyang with every passing year.
The diplomacy is even more complicated now, because a left-of-center president governs in South Korea. To the consternation of the U.S., which has wanted to keep North Korea isolated, South Korean President Moon Jae-in has made multiple overtures to the North to move toward more normal relations. It was a South Korean emissary who passed on Kims invitation to meet with Trump, which Trump impulsively accepted. The same emissary said Kim has already agreed to temporarily suspend nuclear and missile testing as a gesture while talks are ongoing.
What sort of agreement could conceivably result? Ironically, a rough model is the deal with Iran, a bargain negotiated by Barack Obama that Trump scorns and regularly threatens to upend.
North Korea would have to promise to freeze or roll back its nuclear program. In exchange, the U.S. would lift sanctions and maybe even pull some troops from the peninsula. There would be more normalization of relations between South and North, and the whole deal would be guaranteed by the great powers, including China.",8,18,24.555555555555557,0,0.5698517376885694,0.3525467352619017,0.3013556767255068,0.29803860435883206,0.1111111111111111,0.39356787345858046,0.3483847365875879,0.33463713352749536,0.3364049223814903,0.23512646442522173,0.18529517336332418,0.153118863682849,0.16185054832956555,0.133450550193377,1.1367200960583663,0.2262191660868732,0.13218325011412138,1.1477260026625973,0.2272976045507833,0.15783146631303893,1.3518949538770166,0.26761861835003664,0.15734448007243892,1.3497470549399968,0.26782223869443017,0.034722222222222224,0.02896825396825397,0.021739130434782608,0.032377428307123035,3.1093275855852744,3.5292564531047708,0,0,1.1561255935587487,6.297438795183257,9.07421622412721,0.12781861714326193,-0.6694971244896861,-0.45290354349762507,,0.1191869185427239,-0.34957477639042783,-0.169025185464061,-0.11245512035878918,-0.02217082057306287,-0.27355924073768606,-1.2690621838363372,0.08079405515409048,-0.6265920984245239,-0.12020862423884403,-1.1461060501219023,-0.39670293175891647,-1.596598858561163,0.1447680582290204,0.20536804331423256,0.16099498456163291,-0.9506004485098231,-0.8099562336783904,-0.9163700455932874,-0.23825257075059397,0.014190561283273553,-0.30788356519585514,-0.26200196535820325,0.014357789172407038,-0.277409324163354,0.07034022631523792,-0.16040967120695385,-0.4336460542719793,0.10206804284137494,0.11999017208463544,0.15887475749999785,,,0.12427761482581574,-0.2458812907806563,1.018488489531723,0,-1.5213303508226
29,editorials_17.txt,"Its March, which means its choice season for a lot families living in urban areas. Like many households, mine is on pins and needles waiting to learn where our teenage daughter has been accepted to high school.
She has taken three different standardized tests to be considered for admission at various public, Catholic and independent schools. She tried to convince us to hire a tutor, as some of her peers parents have, to give her advantage on these tests. We refused, because it seemed a bit much for eighth grade. Her father and I have spent hours crafting essays and filling out applications. We played in the local lottery to attend schools across town. We have taken off work to take her to visit school after school, where she has arrived, nervous in starched shirts, legs carefully crossed, to implore administrators to accept her. She is 14.
We have done all of this so we can avoid our struggling neighborhood school.
This system of school choice has powerful backers. The most influential is Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the billionaire heiress whose proposed budget would pump hundreds of millions of dollars into the various privatizations schemes such as vouchers and charters that power this system of choice.
Washington, D.C., where I live, recently lost yet another city schools chancellor when it was revealed he had jumped the line to choose a school for his own daughter. Antwan Wilson resigned for violating a policy that he had authored, a policy that was supposed to stop well-connected parents and officials from gaming the system to win their kids spots at top schools. Wilson apologized, explaining that he got tunnel vision in trying to make the best choice he could for his own child.
Hes wrong about this. The tunnel is the feature, not the bug, of school choice. It is the same dark tunnel into which DeVos herself gazed, when she dodged Michigan state taxes for public schools that her own children might have attended if not for her fortune. Radical self-interest and self-preservation is the rotten, racist core of the whole ideology of school choice. There is no we in this: The entire point is to give individual kids an advantage. In putting his daughter above everyone else, Wilson used the school choice system precisely as its designed to operate.
This vision must change, both from the top down and from the bottom up. Families and taxpayers have swallowed the line that a privatized school marketplace will deliver on its promise of upward mobility for all. It is a cynical game that has done nothing to build up communities like mine, despite all promises to the contrary.
There was a time when education was not a public matter at all. In the early 19th century, wealthy families the DeVoses of the day hired their own tutors. Churches set up some private schools. Philanthropists like Sears executive Julian Rosenwald sponsored schools for some black children. The rest of Americas poor children, of all races, mostly worked to support their families and did not go to school. This changed after the Civil War, when reformers convinced the federal government to take over schools previously funded through private philanthropy, thus laying the groundwork for a universal right to education for all American children.",8,30,20.466666666666665,0,0.46156237428558283,0.25375695305665014,0.30429028170183303,0.2762151237311108,0.1,0.446931261519591,0.4099448836856244,0.41352018333890583,0.3768088480421869,0.22352513059973717,0.19239653196479928,0.16142694800496943,0.1828894324287649,0.1419538253145301,1.21575935275196,0.24100584047276308,0.16468128370479757,1.3881094970319634,0.27850251702845774,0.16069298306444063,1.3677312855323522,0.272901799788982,0.1610247965846191,1.368558540982229,0.2726173113230827,0.006944444444444444,0.017503596334865684,0.041666666666666664,0.029299847792998476,3.1915719042906567,3.598684927883551,0,0,1.1879767134574828,6.376483913420727,8.695756047525592,0.12781861714326193,0.8695767249118915,-1.3359269691957851,,-0.68018200504941,-1.1599477406400205,-0.1477108796293847,-0.2820574458879812,-0.08376455667440626,0.9286206028840728,0.7502514802155913,0.6897728770060464,0.12841431211048565,-0.4538096957058496,-0.8511760938841719,-0.2901246070886342,-0.9648562378242037,0.3179871307294849,0.4030002431670287,0.34261007054852244,0.6809878959899452,0.7462922007402554,0.709518661942243,0.019253264326359557,0.3021917867762655,0.09492766391277263,0.1403784635554572,0.3734292920884495,0.1307564886560506,-0.8027781332497282,-0.5042305673378851,0.10824007296703811,-0.12270523296857085,0.8590709498969166,0.8967345270645892,,,0.7861088976840701,0.008380216544140243,-0.4229419829256898,0,-0.6265139222005054
30,editorials_19.txt,"In April 2016, at a campaign stop on the campus of SUNY Purchase, just north of New York City, I filmed a short video of Hillary Clinton. I captured the former secretary of state berating my friend for asking if she would commit to refusing money from the fossil fuel lobby. Im so sick, Clinton answered, Im so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about this.
The video quickly went viral, partly because of the outsized response from a famously tight-lipped politician, partly because it played so well into the Democratic primary narrative that pitted Clinton, buddy-buddy with Wall Street, against the people-powered challenge of Sen. Bernie Sanders.
The furor that the video generated sprang from fissures in the Democratic Party that perfunctory resistance to President Donald Trump has only papered over. Americans care deeply about who finances our lawmakers, an issue often framed as a proxy for whether our politicians can be trusted. One wing of the Democratic Party, represented in 2016 by Clinton, sees corporate money like fossil fuel donations as the price of business in Washington. The other wing, awakened by Sanders muscular grassroots fundraising operation, views big-pocketed donors as anathema.
These factions will battle each other again in primaries this year. To mount the strongest challenge to the party of Trump in November, the Democrats will need to energize their young activist base. They must commit to what Clinton would not refusing fossil fuel money. The wellbeing of our climate and our communities is at stake.
In an era when schoolchildren are cut down by assault weapons with horrifying regularity, climate change can seem like a distant problem, a speck on the horizon. Its not. Its a present and deadly reality just ask the 900,000 Puerto Ricans without power five months after Hurricane Maria slammed into their homes.
Common sense dictates that the economy undergo a massive restructuring away from fossil fuels to save lives. And a growing body of research shows that the only way to avoid catastrophic levels of climate change is to cease production of vast amounts of unburnable carbon. Accomplishing this requires bold government action not faith in the current system that subsidizes both the production of fossil fuels and the salaries of oil and gas executives.",6,18,23.333333333333332,0,0.514582905699225,0.26533045029736374,0.3154156133532524,0.31579042226076126,0.2222222222222222,0.45535232530285913,0.3721578377774175,0.4160970130210949,0.4468751271515583,0.23279774802116057,0.1490234708837962,0.1718840569581112,0.19938807526496724,0.1383563045922148,1.1942692610657974,0.23714842935789185,0.150971819310092,1.3136787474741187,0.25886477115078416,0.1530982358577558,1.322105559273375,0.26078422808076557,0.15240002214976123,1.3176122445053122,0.2612555443021888,0.022727272727272728,0.0030303030303030303,0.0,0.013289036544850499,3.170452200127708,3.578489986691736,0,0,1.1536729420450351,6.259259613939138,8.892029193118196,-0.345583668572523,-0.6694971244896861,-0.7168507631356624,,-0.2887957802852779,-1.0650102981603367,-0.06690657266354161,0.02550406451630957,0.5937665404403716,1.1183318170694192,-0.4892500759630069,0.7096660569442499,1.4377051551379045,-0.18717181133644017,-2.6525236562871597,-0.15597802047382583,-0.4694451782451373,0.24470252051259764,0.3492657538430822,0.29523200344354633,-0.007306128118446311,0.26442576570950005,0.08596932421252854,-0.6641925763096421,-0.5275625630681305,-0.8289652612132241,-0.802594898897501,-0.5990278121989956,-0.836378991928121,-0.3066881562241793,-0.9382793486506731,-1.0247945567145438,-1.2920661891171559,0.6692807294218326,0.6821102723673333,,,0.07331421062256864,-0.36869085053604334,0.3245979445844531,0,1.4325724366837358
31,editorials_21.txt,"As the news arrived Friday night that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had been fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, I felt a visceral numbness. The announcement had certainly been anticipated. Nonetheless, the expected blow still stunned the senses.
I have known Andy since he was a young SWAT operator on the FBI's New York Office SWAT team that I led as senior team leader. No matter my opinions on some of his actions as deputy director, this humiliatingly drawn-out public flogging had happened to ""one of us.""
The McCabe I knew was an ambitious ladder-climber whose sights were squarely fixed on advancement within the organization. But I never doubted his integrity, his dedication to duty, or his character. I found his decision not to immediately recuse himself -- even after his wife left the political arena -- from oversight of a case targeting Hillary Clinton a bad judgment call. The FBI has stated that McCabe acted in accordance with the agency's protocols while his wife was running for office.
And his possible violations of the Hatch Act while supporting his wife's failed Virginia senate campaign in 2015 is also worthy of scrutiny. However, an apparent lack of judgment doesn't equate to accusations of treason and criminality, as some have recklessly charged.
I never doubted Andy's fealty to the Constitution or the FBI's mission.
But the attorney general's decision to fire him was based on an inspector general's report that was critical of McCabe that has not yet been released to the public. The nonpartisan IG for the Department of Justice, Michael E. Horowitz, worked hand in glove with the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) on the case. The IG's recommendation to terminate McCabe is not predicated on timing, ""optics"" or empathy considerations.
Although the IG report's release should clear up any misconceptions as to the evidence gathered, the central charge appears to be ""lack of candor."" Folks unfamiliar with this agency vernacular should understand that what it equates to is ""lying"" to investigators. This covers anything and everything related to an administrative inquiry -- like an OPR investigation -- and doesn't only attach to sworn testimony at trial, or during a deposition, or that which is gathered under oath.
In my quarter-century of service in the FBI, I personally witnessed innumerable instances of forgivable egregious offenses by fellow employees. However, the one violation that always resulted in separation from the FBI was lying. I simply cannot recall an instance when an agent's career survived a proven case of ""lack of candor.""
Horowitz, appointed by President Barack Obama in 2012, heads a fiercely independent agency that relies on the facts it uncovers and follows the evidence, wherever it may lead. In my experience in the FBI, Horowitz's name was synonymous with ruthless efficiency and an apolitical mien.",9,23,23.652173913043477,0,0.4934955760836601,0.30574309002063255,0.30404058402335205,0.30524893491356464,0.0,0.37670787859637783,0.39166182357164464,0.3710153087532079,0.36215746858220976,0.21475096890386544,0.1921607164131083,0.2094933884466688,0.19179732440296648,0.14015348411353232,1.191332148738501,0.2404390000181829,0.14748522104806253,1.244248365557342,0.2490211233438146,0.16027113913381227,1.3653744000377093,0.27155898391275635,0.16256647071281843,1.3772454266893845,0.2757098917172996,0.03333333333333333,0.024242424242424242,0.018867924528301886,0.019566736547868623,3.0828222155064484,3.5140053796659942,0,0,1.2493533407196604,6.352332832336532,9.18567501965861,0.3645197600011544,-0.028216353905695445,-0.6479949667083486,,-0.444457938104942,-0.7335052587256484,-0.14952445683254717,-0.05641965787791157,-0.6381081815864973,-0.6533841867050053,0.15052527991839193,0.3616343414138377,-0.1453681294363831,-0.7061142830057767,-0.8609698635335383,0.32648452884665696,-0.6973755580272182,0.28131262254552303,0.3419217074193077,0.3356479386172438,-0.18235342968541024,-0.18506817081279978,-0.2265920109384064,-0.018708167692302952,0.259329214459833,-0.007454077055224086,0.30893448173946364,0.5392435770165808,0.3940028851281744,0.026684308336989555,-0.302135579058313,-0.5117222715757143,-0.833569916556801,-0.11819782487884486,-0.003207926427658853,,,2.061447789615915,-0.06930567243818445,1.4429984227696295,0,-1.9078845470178056
32,editorials_23.txt,"On Friday, Facebook announced that it had banned Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm with ties to President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign, from using the platform. According to Facebook, ""in 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login"" to Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie. Facebook says that about 270,000 people who downloaded Kogan's app, called ""thisisyourdigitallife,"" gave permission for Kogan to access information about them, such as their locations and posts they liked -- but Kogan violated the rules by sharing it.
Kogan disputes Facebook's claim that he lied about why he was collecting the data.
Wylie helped to found Cambridge Analytica but left in 2014, and now says the firm wrongly used the data to build psychological profiles of 50 million Americans for the Trump campaign.
""Cambridge Analytica will try to pick at whatever mental weakness or vulnerability that we think you have and try to warp your perception of what's real around you,"" Wylie said in an interview with ABC News. ""If you are looking to create an information weapon, the battle space you operate in is social media. That is where the fight happens.""
Facebook says it thought the third parties with whom Kogan shared the data had deleted it in response to the social media company's demands, but has now learned they didn't. Cambridge Analytica said in a statement on Saturday that it deleted the data Kogan provided when it became clear that Kogan had not gathered it in line with Facebook's terms of service.
Being profiled in this way by a political campaign is different than being targeted by a company selling shoes, for example, with a Facebook ad. While companies may select Facebook users based upon generic data such as what school they graduated from or what zip code they live in, industry practices prevent advertisers from knowing the personal identities of the people they're targeting. Congress needs to respond now -- in two ways.
First, we need laws that give Americans more information about how data we share online will be used. As I've argued before, organizations asking us to share personally identifiable information on social media should be required to say who they are, from whom they get funding, and how they're going to use the data. This stipulation could help prevent situations like this in the future.
Second, Congress should force Facebook's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify about what happened. This could shed some light on the shady way this all played out, helping lawmakers figure out how to prevent such episodes from recurring. It would also rightly publicly shame the company for failing to live up to moral obligations it had to its users to be forthcoming and transparent about what it knew.",8,19,28.526315789473685,0,0.5311004873365164,0.33680703025651626,0.31389234657399356,0.28511608225138235,0.05263157894736842,0.43455171287059785,0.39223818361374424,0.3561056721814702,0.42298800601185266,0.22458196692168714,0.19060471631820974,0.19089820633751542,0.2123251012170751,0.15297241881671142,1.2327574289252814,0.2509387035187759,0.16474607454436957,1.369903409277537,0.27750473162581263,0.16622671292881247,1.3964849042270826,0.2821735387155921,0.16769905471034546,1.3966956056442204,0.28193987356677264,0.027216117216117216,0.025233508321743616,0.023529411764705882,0.02161422708618331,3.142239674231562,3.5512483761231692,0,0,1.0775197532819485,5.147048315933104,8.3513718946673,0.12781861714326193,-0.541240970372888,0.40460919398671435,,-0.1668665248272796,-0.478687637223826,-0.07797019937406754,-0.21288317940734777,-0.34634837900118626,0.6497319415805701,0.1694312079138497,0.24653163005309797,0.9913393801595639,-0.42341993753913865,-0.9255928555056678,0.08794056620828125,-0.08098015125077805,0.5424454152744017,0.44550275809352874,0.4646089547546314,0.6842407690716682,0.6284255575289768,0.6778363888905743,0.5172296361638944,0.8251081793898589,0.8018427294206628,0.8700958230331464,0.9105063775002664,0.9243109330700626,-0.16559362491226232,-0.272413329411685,-0.38496323642376806,-0.6840299927839945,0.41575153845039736,0.3925966605425415,,,-1.5090653971608148,-3.946299783261107,-1.7345880763636983,0,2.4899667111816997
33,editorials_25.txt,"The Kutupalong refugee camp is situated in Cox's Bazar, the most southeastern part of Bangladesh, along its border with Myanmar's Rakhine state.
Six months ago, the area was a pristine jungle preserve. Now it is home to more than a half million Rohingya Muslim refugees, who since August have fled rape, torture and murder at the hands of the Myanmar armed forces.
They are, quite rightly, too terrified to return to Myanmar, but they are not allowed to move on, so they sit in a purgatorial limbo.
A heaving, sprawling settlement is fashioned from tarps and bamboo, slapped haphazardly on dusty mud terraces and made up of nearly a million traumatized, persecuted people.
They have almost nothing: no electricity, no paved roads, no sewers. People are reduced to defecating openly -- especially the children, who can't wait for long hours to get to the latrines.
Women and children have to wait after the men, so even if they've been in line, men cut in front of them. One might say the conditions could not be worse, but the monsoon season, with its lashing rains, is coming.
While the Rohingya fled to Bangladesh seeking safety, life in the camp is full of dangers, especially for women and girls. Once the sun sets, basic tasks, like going to a toilet, become unsafe: sexual violence can skyrocket in refugee camps.
Hyper-vigilance is required at all times. It is not a good situation for any of the women and girls. Some 34,000 of them are pregnant, either by their husband or because of this epidemic of rape.
Ajida is a Rohingya who walked and waded to Bangladesh while she was pregnant. Four of her children drowned when the boat they were in capsized.
While I held her hands at a maternity clinic, Ajida looked limply at the confusing identify card that says she is from a country that denies her existence and is actively engaging in what has widely been described as the ethnic cleansing of her people. She explained to me that her baby hasn't moved in months and that she has a terrible burning sensation in her chest.
I met Ajida in my capacity as Goodwill Ambassador for UNFPA, the United Nations reproductive health and rights agency. She was one of hundreds of pregnant women waiting for an urgently needed check-up at a UNFPA-supported reproductive health clinic, and is one of the 47,000 women for whom our health workers have provided vital antenatal care in the past six months.
Patiently waiting for hours, the women with whom I talked, whose babies I held, defied the hell they had lived by maintaining their dignity and composure. It is one thing to cheat death and flee to safety. The determination and resilience required to cross rivers, hills and jungles when pregnant is superhuman.",12,23,23.391304347826086,0,0.5813379341905768,0.3176519536218153,0.277856703226765,0.2877480917506748,0.17391304347826086,0.4407879787031561,0.36302637620998274,0.2140226723252135,0.3035094144748568,0.25016846720661434,0.18179976886178,0.11167959071512724,0.17456616959460672,0.08199037096416174,0.7059860704114077,0.1407788199180911,0.11718818310446588,1.0085095932305677,0.19983355788699864,0.15381064117358415,1.3238714436226133,0.2630564786249236,0.155933916396628,1.3285390470499234,0.2642122803203699,0.0,0.009259259259259259,0.03571428571428571,0.02443609022556391,3.2536422745903,3.6696776248473966,0,0,1.2176139199724105,6.44389623956615,9.053476173702888,1.0746231885748316,-0.028216353905695445,-0.7043315274216053,,0.20397556486441887,-0.6358168046982487,-0.3397003911539778,-0.19242837939126384,0.3259676878258349,0.7902236411480177,-0.7887829066191931,-0.8503521499796927,-1.2412927479575269,0.31233028209442526,-1.291275383840587,-0.9282969933039117,-1.21478203479809,-0.9035203235755147,-0.8716526246566874,-0.8884131116226077,-1.7034391238002025,-1.711246564748606,-1.7884247210767272,-0.6000837341455084,-0.4954480009505725,-0.655719642997667,-0.41622327078244925,-0.3904582498075907,-0.5846959302489386,-1.0210577231409697,-0.7514752258338689,-0.053622016987473584,-0.4779332168215497,1.416860451740701,1.651218262872107,,,1.4019374924233463,0.2252229519362521,0.9394964514516092,0,-5.872357749093642
34,editorials_27.txt,"Jared Kushner's security clearance downgrade is not the end of the story, unless you are talking about his diplomatic career. That is over.
Despite the claim by both White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Kushner's lawyer that ""the new clearance policy will not affect Mr. Kushner's ability to continue to do the very important work he has been assigned by the President,"" it will do exactly that.
The reliance on Jared Kushner as the primary negotiator for everything from Middle East peace to trade deals to the United States' relationships in Asia has been dying a slow death over the last year due to a combination of his lack of experience, lack of respect from world leaders and the actions of his boss and father-in-law, President Donald Trump. The official loss of his interim top security clearance should come as no surprise. A valid question the White House should have to answer is why it took so long.
After working in the White House on and off for eight years and traveling around the world for two years with an actual top diplomat, Secretary of State John Kerry, I can confirm without a doubt that it is not possible to be on the front lines of diplomacy as the chief representative of the United States without the highest level of security clearance.
Why? Because a top-level security clearance gives access to information and insights into foreign powers, their leaders and their thinking about ongoing issues that gives chief negotiators a leg up. And it is impossible to do the job of chief negotiator or chief representative for the president without it.
We don't actually know the real reason for the downgrade, but Kushner's portfolio changes are the least of his problems.
If you believe White House spin, the memo sent to White House staff, including to Jared Kushner, that informed them that their security clearance had been downgraded, was all part of an effort by Chief of Staff John Kelly to take a significant step in clearing the deck of high-level employees with interim security clearances.
Donald Trump had the power to override that decision -- but he didn't. And Kushner's father-in-law, the President, hasn't exactly shied away from breaking the rules, conflicting his own public commitments or making decisions that are clearly conflicts of interest. But he didn't on Kushner's behalf, even though it will significantly reduce his portfolio.
The more likely reasons for Kushner's downgrade affect far more than his job responsibilities.
New reports surfaced on Tuesday that not one, but four foreign powers -- the United Arab Emirates, China, Israel and Mexico -- had been discussing ways to influence Kushner. Why? Because of his lack of experience, knowledge and his financial vulnerabilities.
Jared Kushner's problems are only just beginning

35,editorials_29.txt,"Modeled on the President's Daily Briefing, which the director of national intelligence prepares for the President almost daily, I am providing a glimpse of the kind of intelligence assessments that are likely to come across the desk of the President of the United States this week.
No one, especially Vladimir Putin, considered the Russian election a nail-biter. He and the Central Election Commission may have gone through some of the motions of a democratic election -- campaign speeches, letting opponents' names appear on the ballot, urging Russians to go to the polls -- but, much like previous elections, the outcome was all but guaranteed. This was Putin-esque theater, plain and simple, and with another six-year term stretching ahead of him, at least according to exit polls, we can expect the Russian threat matrix to expand.
Putin may feign dismay over Western sanctions and diplomatic repercussions after his attacks around the world, but his new term will probably mean more hostility.
Cybersecurity -- penchant for penetration: With the news that Russia targeted American and European nuclear power plants and energy and water systems, we have one more indication that Putin views all infrastructure -- whether election related or otherwise -- as free for the taking. Putin seemingly has the ability to enter sensitive systems, poke around and lurk at will. This now public capability bolsters his image as omnipotent and omnipresent. We could expect a show of force from Putin any time to demonstrate his capability to wreak havoc, similar to his shutting off the lights in Ukraine in 2015 -- and then, of course, denying it.
Hiding in plain sight -- chemical weapons are not off limits: A tit-for-tat between Russia and the United Kingdom will likely continue this week after Theresa May's response to Russia's alleged use of a nerve agent against a former Russian double agent and his daughter. The UK took initial retaliatory steps and expelled Russian diplomats, among other measures.
And Putin, unsurprisingly, kicked out UK diplomats and seized some diplomatic properties. Putin doesn't care about diplomatic fallout -- he doesn't need ""diplomats"" in the UK to gather information. He has other means to get intelligence. The brazenness of Putin's attack could signal his willingness to use nerve agents in the future to send a clear message to any rogue agents and to signal to a global audience that he is willing and able to use chemical weapons wherever and whenever he pleases.
Since South Korean shuttle diplomacy resulted in a purported agreement for a face-to-face meeting between the United States and North Korea (the North Koreans have yet to publicly acknowledge that Kim wants to proceed with the meeting, but reporting has indicated the CIA is working with intel partners on the potential meeting), the devil may be in the details. While we wait for official word from Kim, his foreign minister spent three days in Sweden meeting the Swedish foreign minister and the Swedish Prime Minister. Sweden has offered to host a US-NK meeting, but it is unclear whether Kim would be willing to travel based on his deep paranoia about his safety.",7,18,32.833333333333336,0,0.5813658272518831,0.3609429809197881,0.30565245130232405,0.3066671299082892,0.0,0.4582956004245528,0.40546955601521784,0.35221935452686415,0.41753239310332585,0.1975293349603127,0.17729292085643558,0.16098149681431997,0.19045821210937627,0.1365611226124764,1.1704875470653284,0.2324389392450812,0.1600858875909045,1.3668088559666054,0.272480565938677,0.15617695256512662,1.3510825506555946,0.2681874401294262,0.15870254266096362,1.3592859565726467,0.27107543115032273,0.0,0.006926406926406926,0.0,0.015780245470485097,3.0944863481083256,3.5305966910600115,0,0,1.1373082570450992,6.260403187888568,8.923098966536507,-0.10888252571463052,-0.6694971244896861,1.3347389895054425,,0.2041814654782139,-0.2807003408925079,-0.13781731654413745,-0.04539808101479587,-0.6381081815864973,1.1846384395328977,0.6034504938311736,0.2165291751239008,0.8893932783395094,-1.2013293696849834,-1.478451466556679,-0.2958389739367651,-0.7375855951102189,0.2081331101302058,0.28980122127032476,0.23738840525025046,0.4502725600337846,0.608391346120258,0.5183061043878335,-0.3871410733580881,-0.000583890809309295,-0.2645142804670307,-0.11352076678366886,0.19643525704040934,-0.0004913198180306118,-1.0210577231409697,-0.8214366154602396,-1.0247945567145438,-1.1101189781922294,-0.013379202369703845,0.17311830342213727,,,-0.26672596697599915,-0.36501235852283725,0.44293250379659255,0,-1.3233817106003978
36,editorials_3.txt,"Weve heard passionate pleas in recent weeks from students who survived a massacre and lost their friends and teachers. Through their pain, with Wednesdays National School Walkout and in many other ways, this generation of students growing up with active-shooter drills is demanding that lawmakers take action to reform gun laws.
Unfortunately, theres a lot of misleading information about reasonable measures to ensure gun safety, and it distracts from the fundamental issue at hand: the safety of our children, communities, schools and businesses.
One frequent refrain: Criminals don't follow the law. This is absurd on its face. By this logic, we shouldnt criminalize murder, rape or kidnapping. Laws exist to deter crime, and when a crime is committed, laws are there to ensure punishment is meted out.
Banning assault weapons wont prevent all shootings, but contrary to Republican talking points, we already know that banning these military-style weapons does reduce mass killings of six people or more. When the original ban was in place from 1994 to 2004, the number of such massacres fell by 37% and the number of people dying from them fell by 43%. After the ban expired, the number of gun massacres killing six or more increased by 183% and the number of people dying from them increased by 239%.
Another canard: The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. Tell that to the 49 people killed in Orlando at the Pulse nightclub, where an armed guard was on duty and was unable to prevent the murders.
Another particularly terrible idea floated recently: arming teachers. How can we expect teachers, who already have too much on their plates, to undergo the same training as law enforcement officers and be able to confront killers armed with AR-15s?
The falsehood that is most frustrating, however, is that Democrats have no ideas to counter this violence. That couldnt be further from the truth.
The first is getting military-style assault weapons such as the AR-15 off the streets.
These weapons fire much faster than typical hunting rifles. They fire rounds that are also deadlier than those fired from a hunting rifle. A Parkland radiologist noted that an AR-15 round may leave an exit wound the size of an orange. These weapons are designed to kill people, not animals.
Our current bill would ban 205 weapons by name, and any other weapons that accept a detachable magazine and have one military characteristic. The 1994 ban required two additional characteristics, a loophole that gun manufacturers exploited. We'd close that loophole.
Importantly, the bill also bans high-capacity magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds. The shooter at the grade school in Newtown, Conn., for example, used 30-round magazines.
High-capacity magazines also lead to deadlier mass shootings. While law enforcement might be able to respond to mass shootings in a matter of minutes, a matter of minutes is all it takes to fire hundreds of rounds. In Las Vegas, for example, the shooter fired 1,100 rounds in just 10 minutes 110 rounds per minute.",12,29,20.551724137931036,0,0.5588882778372083,0.3180540468534592,0.3766394141647551,0.3664799606841471,0.034482758620689655,0.3743370008324423,0.4023532930404402,0.3762414620861549,0.3356020938877985,0.20897791264278273,0.17892150295215445,0.18688557416683546,0.16332093696297578,0.14319337685678957,1.141183144313687,0.23420263563263494,0.13828419336308426,1.1344686316884,0.22988839962205845,0.16495808734403059,1.3608042831487601,0.2735106541648497,0.1656191259621248,1.3709327209525322,0.27771353676780397,0.10694444444444444,0.04450549450549451,0.06779661016949153,0.025423728813559324,3.1820659004072125,3.567694055015011,0,0,1.157555952327587,7.050767841933707,8.99702341501621,1.0746231885748316,0.7413205707950934,-1.3175582285187801,,0.03825700239191534,-0.6325184323690641,0.377767523299893,0.41944047380233146,-0.44695520747887973,-0.7067957402637044,0.5012299387742432,0.4019803562690516,-0.6415941223463503,-0.872120863223811,-1.410814036428852,0.036465448998589944,-1.55244693660596,0.343237868287367,0.21652758708584946,0.2590507386946116,-0.6442979804639323,-0.8957847672772883,-0.8341055860697683,0.4030669319095069,0.17621657869862634,0.1413491965301344,0.6426907563631878,0.41874736893873427,0.5645570089080497,2.3404479611841493,0.30554649911586457,0.8187872136148099,-0.4058003320046639,0.7736461466441813,0.5673751628232298,,,0.1539988987849831,2.177324382248794,0.7244864407393894,0,-0.08521701687724603
37,editorials_31.txt,"North Korea has earned a reputation as a country that knows how to play a weak diplomatic hand well. Or at least, it is known to have confounded U.S. negotiators and persisted in its nuclear drive by hook or by crook, despite both its relative weakness and repeated American efforts to halt and reverse North Korea's nuclear development.
What lessons should the U.S. government bear in mind if President Trump indeed ends up sitting across the negotiating table from Kim Jong Un, and what should Trump do differently?
Kim Jong Un is different from his father and grandfather. President Trump is also unmistakably different from his predecessors who have dealt with North Korea. Here are some lessons from prior negotiating experience between the countries.
1. America's attention deficit disorder limits its ability to hold North Korea to commitments
North Korean ideology places the country at the center of global attention and as the most important item on the U.S. agenda. At moments when it becomes the biggest global crisis, North Korea draws top-level attention, as President Trump has shown. But when the crisis abates, American presidents have a tendency to move on to other crises, even though North Korea continues to demand attention.
During Clinton-era negotiations, the issue received top-level attention until the United States and North Korea signed the Agreed Framework in Geneva in 1994. But the Clinton administration did not hold North Korea's feet to the fire to implement the deal.
One result of the Clinton administration's failure to pay sufficient attention to implementing the agreement is that it provided space for North Koreans to cut corners and eventually pursue an alternative covert uranium enrichment path to securing materials for a bomb.
Whatever the merits of any agreement Trump may achieve with Kim, it will mean nothing unless the president and his staff are willing to see the deal through to implementation. Otherwise, the North Koreans will exploit the American attention deficit and push forward once again with nuclear development.
2. North Korea has tried limiting the scope of negotiated commitments to avoid denuclearization
In six-nation talks a decade ago, the North Koreans skillfully forced the United States to make a choice between addressing the urgent question of plutonium pathways to making a bomb at the expense of including North Korean uranium enrichment efforts on the negotiating agenda. North Korea also limited negotiations and inspections to the site of its 5 megawatt reactor at Yongbyon in an effort to restrict verification of all aspects of its nuclear program. Christopher Hill, lead U.S. negotiator in the Six-Party Talks, accepted limitations on the agenda as an expedient way to start North Korea's denuclearization, but the process broke down before a broader verification of the country's entire nuclear program could begin. Today, verifying the scope of the program is even more difficult because of the North's uranium enrichment efforts, which are harder to assess and easier to hide.",10,22,24.545454545454547,0,0.6925961559727078,0.5149696936339011,0.43937714248895643,0.4403789679209391,0.09090909090909091,0.4427235573530197,0.4196153849599181,0.2972548582427936,0.3934054366803713,0.22520292116837068,0.18601532029532283,0.11091665180766175,0.18282134199314848,0.09327529115370793,0.8112317366843856,0.1596514002480115,0.1378735322314188,1.1969681262827627,0.2362757317764083,0.1553836628986646,1.3374966818978289,0.26498794182287666,0.15600957065153073,1.3437917502925467,0.26547474565871004,0.004273504273504273,0.006074481074481075,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,3.0881264616413056,3.497333030711409,0,0,1.1075637946064776,6.295052818488173,8.841500425762222,0.6012209028590468,-0.1564725080224936,-0.4550849254781048,,1.0252599661383501,0.9827813772514246,0.8334374140219071,0.9937504885732068,-0.13415943166641453,0.8338286992817004,1.067466046488709,-0.20779790491145722,0.43854583051962276,-0.4055641456843633,-1.1161972798346254,-0.9380841773803842,-0.9669008153807234,-0.6736367339440081,-0.6084931084793576,-0.6566135054391041,-0.6649155330335342,-0.49116155939189415,-0.6312912325531221,-0.45852864008128075,-0.24765795674712268,-0.5084570373619111,-0.40795175624391383,-0.09931638761947907,-0.47723245036318657,-0.8867318216694365,-0.8469855606806549,-0.5303794455807626,-0.9347184117587422,-0.07053171953847141,-0.18039539305324662,,,-0.8847832219883883,-0.2535561737394137,0.1321504705685013,0,2.1070721758634026
38,editorials_33.txt,"Bailey Holt and Preston Cope were killed in their high school this week. They were both 15 years old. But has the news of students being killed in their school lost the power to shock and sober us?
At least 16 other students, all between 14 and 18, at Marshall County High School in Kentucky were injured when another student, age 15, opened fire in their school on Tuesday.
""Bailey Holt and Preston [Cope] were two great people,"" their friend, Gabbi Bayers, said on Facebook. ""It hurts knowing we won't be able to share the laughs anymore.""
And Jasen Holt told WKRN in Nashville of his daughter, ""She was an angel here on Earth.""
That's how parents feel about their children in their souls.
To report that two students were killed in their school was once the kind of story that would dominate the news of a week. And to be sure, the deplorable deaths and bright lives of those two youngsters have received intense attention.
But the killings in Kentucky were the 11th school shooting of the year, and the first month of the year is not over.
There have been almost 300 school shootings in the United States since 2013, according to the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. While we may remember some of the names of places where students died Santa Monica, Calif.; Roseburg, Ore.; Rancho Tehama Reserve, Calif. and many of the names of the victims, those harrowing statistics suggest school shootings now occur at the rate of almost one per week.
If another school shooting takes place next week, we may be shocked and saddened all over again. But not surprised.
School shootings have become commonplace. News organizations now know whom to call for reflections on how families and towns can try to contend with loss and grief, and on counsel and care for sad and traumatized students. And of course, we know who to call to hear from those who dispute even the most modest regulation on guns. We have had to make those calls time and time again.
Many U.S. schools now have routine drills on how to take shelter if a gunman bursts into their school. Parents may worry if those drills do more to prepare or panic their children. But it's hard to say training to hide from a shooter doesn't make as much sense as fire drills, when the tragic and outrageous fact is that more youngsters are injured or killed in school shootings each year than in school fires.
The fear of children dying in their classrooms has become an everyday fact of our lives. But have we stopped being shocked?",12,24,20.916666666666668,0,0.5522379836310511,0.3095980076679447,0.23072972355617416,0.23134047538042068,0.0,0.48013175775607425,0.43185951672557765,0.29781030068794884,0.32270612886382477,0.25649358759013313,0.21521756411720144,0.16794558049076133,0.1662807244669508,0.10185616087958849,0.8709374849083155,0.17383549568806847,0.11582804206955111,0.9984484640223305,0.19770893046109608,0.15241224219033142,1.3094010317035811,0.25853800666613297,0.1541237872213234,1.316999783501275,0.2633374431200711,0.03361111111111111,0.017592592592592594,0.041666666666666664,0.025510204081632654,3.2275206886341956,3.641081759421393,0,0,1.1712722337722339,6.404538940253226,8.44759900416079,1.0746231885748316,0.1000398002111027,-1.2387464019654164,,-0.010834047311311821,-0.7018833544046128,-0.6819879787055482,-0.6308031316661742,-0.6381081815864973,1.6765672536497174,1.4691015809112244,-0.20350987742436208,-0.8825740792173915,0.4942116906325106,0.09661522207749906,-0.20650184851513165,-1.4635722650326306,-0.4988369921989963,-0.45920301063473995,-0.4823995039831462,-1.7717260327065767,-1.7763825534731223,-1.8558871494326274,-0.725924653223429,-0.7586084636619954,-1.0002263127850017,-0.6141303126191098,-0.6107183980837788,-0.6591637568280228,0.03541549193263927,-0.5015616020654418,0.10824007296703811,-0.39948454946309336,1.1821212944344526,1.3473121387499647,,,0.4390081597911045,0.09862378337692877,-1.3680906309893694,0,-1.6410430497498079
39,editorials_35.txt,"Last week was extraordinarily difficult at NPR, as the top newsroom executive, Michael Oreskes, was forced to resign in the wake of profoundly unsettling allegations that he had engaged in multiple incidents of sexual harassment over the span of two decades, including while at NPR.
Oreskes had been at NPR since April 2015; his departure is yet another dramatic high-level staff change at an organization that had seen until the last three years or so a virtual revolving door of chief executives and heads of the news department.
Listeners and readers have contacted me with many questions (and lots of anger). I am NPR's news ombudsman (or public editor), not a corporate ombudsman, and so many of the decisions made by NPR's corporate side are largely outside my purview, unless they reflect on NPR's journalism. That said, serious questions have been raised about NPR's handling of this situation. Chief executive Jarl Mohn (to whom I report, with a contract that is designed to keep my work independent) has apologized to staffers and announced that an outside law firm is being hired to examine NPR's actions in the Oreskes case. I hope for, and expect, a thorough assessment.
In the meantime, here are answers to some initial questions that have been asked by NPR's listeners and readers about how the newsroom has responded to this situation, and how the broader issues of sexual harassment and sexual assault have been reported by NPR.
The story about NPR was broken not by NPR's own journalists, but by TheWashington Post, which wrote about two women who alleged they were harassed two decades ago when they met Oreskes to discuss job options when he was an executive at The New York Times. Both women had contacted NPR in mid-October about those allegations (and one had previously contacted NPR in 2016, as well).
That the company was looking into allegations for a couple of weeks and didn't alert the newsroom frustrated some (I am referring to the issue of informing NPR for its reporting purposes, not the separate issue of leaving newsroom employees potentially vulnerable). But that is the way it should be, if the newsroom and corporate operations are to remain editorially independent (although I'll address, below, one problematic editorial aspect of the separation, concerning Oreskes' oversight of NPR's coverage of sexual harassment in general).
NPR subsequently jumped quickly on the story; The Washington Post story hit at about 4 p.m. on Halloween and NPR's media reporter David Folkenflik was interviewed on All Things Considered at 7:35 p.m. and again on Morning Editionthe morning of Nov. 1. He was able to move so quickly partly because, as he reported, he had previously been looking into a complaint about Oreskes that had been filed internally. (Folkenflik had not been able to report it because the woman did not initially want to go on the record.)
NPR also got beat on the second-day story: The Associated Press, where Oreskes worked before coming to NPR, broke the story that he had resigned from NPR (under pressure). That rankled NPR employees, who wanted to hear it from NPR first, and, of course, no newsroom wants to get scooped about internal news by a competitor.",8,17,36.35294117647059,0,0.5863445876166224,0.4956407355665065,0.31454073218628764,0.3150492231672009,0.17647058823529413,0.4035368790970214,0.38984711686923196,0.29125094612710495,0.4117726173374136,0.26878432268577235,0.22246252522692733,0.17131527328202206,0.2619138248169179,0.1209217152654663,1.0190242315077107,0.21252639104182294,0.1552253663188255,1.3273807391508692,0.2709984237398693,0.1579642389198644,1.3254814551559935,0.2692201149941767,0.15560962966317776,1.3294522860233096,0.2719120273550993,0.039351851851851846,0.032774170274170275,0.06451612903225806,0.02304147465437788,3.175060958273441,3.574236937546608,0,0,1.1459547780099928,6.263151225977078,9.033321685074082,0.12781861714326193,-0.7977532786064844,2.0948222931155103,,0.2409336098118566,0.8242258597143288,-0.07326091504083489,0.01974379684442029,0.3401452741407222,-0.04897571868351289,0.09099874833631537,-0.2541482341070947,0.7817634489257266,0.8476367759460189,0.39750920348996693,-0.163274529385752,1.408039421187361,-0.11045515104070641,-0.08892233336397001,-0.007184448643373008,0.20624641507981584,0.3531327842645879,0.4712442474799845,-0.22630445932360616,-0.4661681585752642,-0.18577895094127153,-0.4516785460189295,-0.37302644830296317,0.07072135960705815,0.21585995290939872,-0.04627163091444707,0.7295816440827443,-0.5797899542788999,0.710696897841915,0.6369104624597945,,,-0.08706075957826001,-0.35617284607538546,0.8627346258687326,0,-3.6958472579364967
40,editorials_37.txt,"Sexual ""misconduct,"" ""abuse,"" ""assault,"" and ""harassment."" NPR has used all sometimes multiple descriptors in the same story to characterize the allegations that have been leveled against former Alabama judge and current Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore.
For some listeners, calling the allegations ""misconduct"" minimizes them.
""Please stop using the phrase 'sexual misconduct' to describe Roy Moore's alleged abuse of children. The allegations are about sexual assault, sexual abuse, sexually predatory behavior. 'Sexual misconduct' doesn't cut it,"" wrote Marjory Ruderman, of Charlottesville, Va.
Other listeners have complained about a single reference, in this story, to Moore's alleged victims as ""very young women,"" instead of ""teenagers."" (That issue seems to surface regularly; NPR recently changed the headline in this piece, which initially only referred to the teenage victims as women and not as girls, following many social media complaints.)
NPR should always use very clear language when describing any situation.
As Mark Memmott, NPR's standards and practices editor, often points out, the best language is to give the actual facts, to the extent they can be known; labels should be secondary. That means including the ages of the alleged victims, or descriptions in their own words, of what they said happened to them.
But labels are also sometimes necessary for the fluidity of the narrative, and in particular for headlines and for newscasts, where the amount of space or time for detailed description is limited.
We went back and looked at the many stories devoted to the Moore allegations, as well as some of the other recent coverage of sexual harassment and abuse. For the most part, the reporting has been quite clear. Even the story that used the inexact phrase ""very young women"" also called them ""teenagers"" and specified the age (16 at the time) of one of the alleged victims. The story also quoted her saying, ""And he then looked at me, and he told me he said, you're just a child."" I don't believe any listener would have come away misled.
As for the phrase ""sexual misconduct,"" NPR has used it quite a bit. Perhaps too much; it's a convenient catchall, but it means different things to different people. At the same time, many of the stories that use the phrase, either in the headline or in the story itself, also include sound bites of the accusers, which include more detail. Still, NPR should sharpen its language in these stories. As Memmott wrote in recent guidance to the newsroom, ""To only say he's accused of 'misconduct' or 'inappropriate' behavior does not reflect the seriousness of the accusations.""
[Memmott's advice appears to have been heeded in NPR's Thursday and Friday coverage of allegations against Sen. Al Franken (D.-Minn.), which refers clearly to accusations of behavior that would be ""sexual assault."" The Franken story also underscores the need for descriptions, and not just labels, since the Moore and Franken allegations are on a different scale.]",10,25,24.12,0,0.5348161918421587,0.3939630496377746,0.28010894879698756,0.2910603959113359,0.0,0.3955676686999045,0.37546525917758833,0.3600875459378585,0.3381514736341815,0.2557467467298633,0.2255240575293799,0.17735566182721715,0.19551011320454853,0.11461774074911757,0.9764583272075947,0.1969919578208254,0.13765574490989,1.1695427903815525,0.23613755303792247,0.1586589982029182,1.325566561974415,0.26769958765077145,0.15942923251366728,1.325798869833189,0.2690991104139348,0.00625,0.01373015873015873,0.05263157894736842,0.039927404718693285,3.0606486387102025,3.493953019317073,0,0,1.1920220165729147,6.338357807990494,8.982021776816154,0.6012209028590468,0.22829595432790084,-0.5469647344959074,,-0.13943798874836308,-0.009836589911411895,-0.3233421244414968,-0.16668663369582448,-0.6381081815864973,-0.22850749987479627,-0.3807590872149355,0.27727178011988474,-0.5939552352844509,0.4727359780162547,0.5246591812132685,-0.08578681181524124,-0.5858902284491377,-0.2388725670633947,-0.1953554358179481,-0.197983769137051,-0.6758497101551975,-0.6687138334015318,-0.6356787656950555,-0.16378357096165727,-0.4646203968500948,-0.3017101365665392,-0.03406950935774552,-0.44276244041008683,-0.16871954538013326,-0.8246060922388524,-0.6173945832406492,0.4064070807779807,0.653485925339633,-0.31745857192394467,-0.21631688544519476,,,0.8701658526341288,-0.11425861620441716,0.6673501295097295,0,-1.7235715625961228
41,editorials_39.txt,"NPR listeners are a compassionate bunch. All week they have been emailing to say they are anxious to know what happened to 19-year-old Jada Wilson in northeast Houston, who on Sunday told Michel Martin of being trapped with her family in her grandmother's home in waist-deep water, in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey flooding. As Martin noted, listeners could hear the water, seemingly lapping around her, in the background.
""Ever since I heard that, I have been on the verge of tears and waiting to hear if she and her family got rescued,"" Colorado listener Lara Duran wrote. ""Please follow up on this family. I am very concerned. Please, if you are going to do a story on trapped people, please follow up.""
That's the power of radio, to create that intimacy between listeners and interview subjects. With that comes a certain responsibility, in my opinion. In this case, listeners need an update on how Wilson and her family fared.
The weekend and weekday All Things Considered staffs are separate; the weekend crew passed Wilson's contact information on to the weekday staff. Christopher Turpin, NPR's vice president of news programming and operations, told me All Things Considered had indeed been trying to reach the family all week, without success. ""We are as anxious as those listeners to track Jada and her family down,"" he wrote in an email, and said the show would update listeners if and when they do.
(While NPR hasn't talked to her, later Sunday night Wilson posted this on Twitter: ""UPDATE: we are safer than we were before. Thank you for all of the prayers, concerns and advice. We are finding a place to stay now. Thanks!"")
""I'm a huge believer in following up on compelling individual stories at moments like this,"" Turpin wrote. ""In the aftermath of Katrina it was folks we went back to time and time again"" people such as Randy Adams, whose last interview of nine total was in 2015, 10 years after he and his family fled the New Orleans hurricane ""who became like family to our listeners, who really helped us understand the arc of the tragedy.""",6,19,22.63157894736842,0,0.3686479375594192,0.2677331103392528,0.2589848536170191,0.2743411864956013,0.0,0.42212998441287447,0.39135495185476116,0.36732433506184153,0.3815621112566934,0.24906442181340285,0.22765261971042106,0.2165380751905549,0.21646987136038237,0.1651119011708914,1.3766170690117092,0.29403599081379306,0.16779463764976477,1.4075337165139565,0.28956502200358825,0.16617388497895513,1.4048255161066947,0.2857383877832597,0.16589016268534643,1.3981911574858512,0.2827048174810381,0.125,0.06335978835978835,0.0,0.03986710963455149,3.230426166724533,3.6828155550578723,0,0,1.1404485428051,6.009066336668796,8.964391647733493,-0.345583668572523,-0.541240970372888,-0.8683994059900373,,-1.3660565077516247,-1.0453012685748237,-0.4767683704878415,-0.29662084750387374,-0.6381081815864973,0.36989304608643986,0.14045918553386993,0.33313994603449343,0.21723598325328922,0.2805830078875147,0.6130615259101486,0.41685565194554985,0.04347644731876709,0.7897371756921994,0.8052138476161697,0.9939448509555526,0.8372961844510738,0.8720450575990841,1.0607818717751367,0.5124756869386266,0.9767914413326821,1.073641313498933,0.6723240426798216,0.9390533007075904,0.9894244315938914,2.9079748949013777,0.8709798872024279,-1.0247945567145438,0.6490822311013874,1.2082310980139,1.7908432537500591,,,-0.2014742785050542,-1.1734783088857776,0.6002027600789528,0,-3.363219089559535
42,editorials_41.txt,"Remember then-treasurer Joe Hockey's impassioned plea to the nation just on three years ago when he released the most recent Intergenerational Report?
""Madam Speaker, we need to ensure that we can pay for today, and we also need to ensure Australians will be able to afford the future. We are currently living beyond our means.""
He ended with a flourish.
""We need to ensure that we take the steps now to ensure our prosperity for generations to come, that we leave nobody behind.""
Fine sentiments. But rarely has the future looked more uncertain for our younger generations.
A rapidly expanding population may have kept our economy growing but it has put upward pressure on housing costs, downward pressure on wages and is squeezing the life out of our urban areas.
And increasingly, the older generation of which your columnist sadly now is a member appears determined not to ensure the prosperity of future generations, but to grab as much of the pie as humanly possible right now.
Woe betide anyone who stands in the way.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Treasurer Scott Morrison learned that the hard way when they attempted to unwind some of the more generous aspects of superannuation two years ago.
And last week's move by Opposition Leader Bill Shorten to rescind a generous tax handout to retireeswho own shares sparked an uproar. More on that later.
Our taxation system overwhelmingly favours older Australians.
Thanks to an overhaul in 2007, retirees over the age of 60 can have up to $1.6 million in super and pay absolutely no income tax on the investment earnings the fund earns. Earnings on anything above that $1.6 million limit are taxed at just 15 per cent.
It's a policy that has distorted our tax system and left the federal budget bereft of billions.
Think about this. A retiree, earning $60,000 a year from a super fund pays no tax at all.
Compare that to a 30-year-old, earning exactly the same amount through a wage, who racks up an $11,047 tax bill.
Then add in a Medicare levy of $1,200.
On top of that, many younger workers have student loans to repay as well.",17,22,18.772727272727273,0,0.720133598006907,0.33872217756156303,0.10824858221937628,0.10824858221937628,0.0,0.41206474407679505,0.40531078821075134,0.049756238711815254,0.25621214890200383,0.2084317463553614,0.20657608890860985,0.03355316204183242,0.1495086983597579,0.033078321919994956,0.2692224641437246,0.054614878903457974,0.1150071722700368,0.9426021966742065,0.1898997030898604,0.1743762380005348,1.4522670262364588,0.2917490617953695,0.17926909949836514,1.462606950414202,0.29502698641550135,0.0,0.013445378151260503,0.0,0.02608695652173913,3.1010021247344812,3.508785688431619,0,0,1.0780090128450783,5.976083615837714,8.731995804216004,2.2581289028642937,-0.1564725080224936,-1.7017447273222208,,1.228535474513455,-0.46297767649791943,-1.571579772658294,-1.5874182422450702,-0.6381081815864973,0.14314153174463795,0.5982425466107072,-2.118492510308911,-2.125111290941776,-0.8878260968998447,-0.2622780613246307,-1.9305236869235678,-1.9671923086655512,-1.8999010884941128,-1.963749842333573,-1.9467086517796666,-1.8129384215578104,-2.1379326106292873,-2.1038503620053546,1.2505995379988102,1.839567831343863,1.5319195336526896,2.1350847360643574,2.168614619063009,2.038311171865551,-1.0210577231409697,-0.6259350488148083,-1.0247945567145438,-0.3573610259032268,0.04517420694433126,-0.058680845624951426,,,-1.498899120893406,-1.2795726066890845,-0.2849166559888781,0,-2.4181144522756934
43,editorials_43.txt,"The news that an Uber self-driving vehicle has killed a pedestrian in the US has made headlines around the world.
It's a reminder that the era of self-driving cars is fast approaching. Decades of research into advanced sensors, mapping, navigation and control methods have now come to fruition and autonomous cars are starting to hit the roads in pilot trials.
But partial or full autonomy raises the question of who is to blame in the case of an accident involving a self-driving car.
In conventional (human-driven) cars, the answer is usually simple: the driver is responsible because they are in control. When it comes to autonomous vehicles, it isn't so clear cut.
We propose a blockchain-based framework that uses sensor data to ascertain liability in accidents involving self-driving cars.
Uber has suspended self-driving car tests as US authorities gather data about the circumstances surrounding the accident, which involved a car moving in autonomous mode with an operator behind the wheel.
For partially autonomous vehicles, which still involve human control, assigning liability depends on what action led to the collision and whether it was based on decisions by the driver or the vehicle. For fully autonomous vehicles, the blame can be assigned to, or shared by, one of many parties including the manufacturer, the service centre and the vehicle owner.
Manufacturers could be liable in the case of a design fault, the software provider for buggy system software, or the service centre for inadequate service to the vehicle. On the other hand, negligence liability might fall to the owner for failing to implement a software update from the manufacturer, or with the manufacturer if the accident could have been prevented by a human driver.
In this complex web of potentially responsible parties, how can the circumstances surrounding an accident be determined?",9,13,26.76923076923077,0,0.7595593507091204,0.5700396457925822,0.2616996169090271,0.2616996169090271,0.15384615384615385,0.28285426418296994,0.3102002114915039,0.10777029985630954,0.25923571362500153,0.21806818908080458,0.20725007682993282,0.08443662780854437,0.1996303552209779,0.05107618086862774,0.4427434537497369,0.08723959840120102,0.16498283356239607,1.4000060769529954,0.27824311909681065,0.16512332284856546,1.3966636136923483,0.2780123142154186,0.1652061293679455,1.393454726781734,0.2774477416938302,0.007407407407407408,0.003968253968253968,0.025,0.03536585365853658,3.148586416221198,3.5143115117912167,0,0,1.1326837822671156,6.534221430832331,9.079812009392098,0.3645197600011544,-1.3107778950736768,0.025154707455182636,,1.5195679499939485,1.4345204070955582,-0.45705079502490875,-0.39486546928517774,0.21472816443210432,-2.7677350103418004,-2.5216019667426646,-1.6706227247075052,-2.0686115644621927,-0.6107262679753027,-0.23428634321885103,-1.2777769977265432,-0.4621701453279665,-1.5332691273194172,-1.5298725978977714,-1.5460004815548054,0.6961274345583478,0.8233109408397491,0.701282105185956,0.41793635616109354,0.8283582088868331,0.48457405809401216,0.5975365566752621,0.8486448509143695,0.5419320205473646,-0.7882261605903121,-0.9101505425122354,-0.34497377890559455,0.3203298081040091,0.47278593401852353,4.55308907208316e-05,,,-0.3628174728504955,0.515768652832592,1.0398009971529074,0,-4.62383653205797
44,editorials_45.txt,"Human rights lawyer Yu Wensheng did the unthinkable in Xi Jinping's China. In an open letter, last October he criticised the President's ""totalitarian rule"" and called for immediate political reform and democracy.
The next day, as he was walking his son to school, he was detained by a squad of security police and man-handled into a van. His wife, Xu Yan, hasn't seen him since.
""I am very worried about Yu Wensheng, he acted within the laws and did what he thought was right but he lost his freedom,"" she said.
""I've run around to different departments but no-one can tell me what's happening. I can't see any hope for the future.""
From today, the National People's Congress has handed Mr Xi a powerful new weapon to deal with any dissent or opposition, even before it surfaces.
It can overrule the highest courts in the land and is only answerable to the cabinet and, of course, Xi Jinping.
Xi now controls Communist Party
People in China are bracing themselves for another round of repression.
Mr Xi has already targeted human rights lawyers, NGOs, the media, academics and he's now tipped to go further.
It is not surprising that the Congress will approve a domestic security budget that is a whopping $320 billion 20 per cent more than the national defence budget.
Mr Xi has put a bigger priority on fighting the enemy within rather than abroad.
The end of the 13th National People's Congress means Mr Xi's remaking of the Chinese political system is complete. China now has a much more centralised structure of governance answerable to him, collective leadership with an emphasis on consensus has been discarded.
Professor Stein Ringen from Oxford University, author of The Perfect Dictatorship China in the 21st Century, says the curtain has been pulled aside and Mr Xi has finally revealed his true nature:
""It's been extraordinary and rapid how he has amassed power. He's moved from being a cautious leader to a very adventurous one showing off power.
""He can launch policies on his own without any process and no safeguards. This is now a system with more instability than it had two to three months ago.""
Professor Ringen says at the same time there's also been a dramatic shift in how an emboldened Mr Xi is projecting China's power and influence overseas.
""We are now hearing from Xi Jinping that the Chinese model is one for others, one that they can learn from. This is an entirely new direction. And for many developing nations the model is attractive for its ability to deliver growth while democracy dithers,"" he says.
Susan Shirk, a former China advisor to US President Bill Clinton and now a professor at the University of California, says this is a turning point for China and is a direct challenge to America and the democratic world.
""Xi Jinping has thrown down the political gauntlet and is ready to compete. This is something previous Chinese leaders didn't want to say because it would provoke a major reaction on the part of democratic countries because it reeks of cold war ideological competition,"" she says.
""For decades we've said the China-US relationship was different from US-Soviet relationship because we don't compete about political systems, but this is something very new.""",20,29,22.03448275862069,0,0.6931969507464341,0.43327744582236694,0.14578260965645312,0.14995855117837587,0.06896551724137931,0.4005934862868377,0.38579593565917075,0.1283040473703295,0.26635780496478434,0.21967788865030916,0.17612278463682693,0.06595692501713832,0.13380327291697974,0.04838755644711989,0.41191066813548616,0.08229781378721604,0.11438806438465311,0.9770966624712573,0.19541418414820833,0.1556682990989332,1.3162076324723169,0.2629864130165595,0.1550313375565141,1.3186281713278534,0.2644121672820529,0.0,0.005714285714285714,0.05555555555555555,0.03636363636363636,3.1298349240918415,3.5385623361573044,0,0,1.1958222887339356,6.146111910157674,8.566456681821068,2.9682323314379713,0.7413205707950934,-0.9973463977980271,,1.0296949046815391,0.31265955354194747,-1.2989666794294739,-1.2632670285192973,-0.2558022333712621,-0.11528499245410762,-0.0418892637731935,-1.5121017572856217,-1.9355248772152984,-0.5644387023208186,-1.527048959432152,-1.514839560833765,-2.43878512614712,-1.5880387333782804,-1.6069678478209393,-1.6066972017351056,-1.844021200980801,-1.9146146222890328,-1.9287512934424376,-0.4329144330676763,-0.6348228922618813,-0.6610617297969833,-0.5149050172060129,-0.579635916726006,-0.5676811672816742,-1.0210577231409697,-0.8577876880083745,0.4859182828608987,0.39320357570894315,0.30427742660719537,0.25777418956466647,,,0.9491313335194306,-0.7326488830534389,-0.9154007865691233,0,-4.537649921043031
45,editorials_47.txt,"The Secretary of State fired, and then humiliated by the President's chief of staff. The National Security Adviser threatened with his own firing. A long-term law-enforcement official axed two days before he would have received a pension.
And a Twitter diatribe against a seasoned investigator who may very well hold his fate in his hands.
It's easy to look from afar at the nastiness of Donald Trump's administration and wonder why it is at such a fever pitch.
This is what it looks like when Mr Trump is in over his head, and there is no-one who can counsel him or calm him down.
Veteran political operatives, who might be able to be of assistance, are staying far away. Those who remain on staff never know when they will be bullied privately or criticised in public.
Incredibly, this could all get more chaotic before the dust settles.
On Sunday night, the New York Times reported Mr Trump now feels unshackled, and free to say whatever he likes.
Earlier on Sunday, he turned his wrath on Robert Mueller, the former Federal Bureau of Investigations director who is leading the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
It was the first time he had mentioned Mr Mueller by name, and his Twitter tirade flummoxed legal experts who said Mr Trump was simply handing Mr Mueller ammunition.
The White House quickly issued a statement saying there was no discussion or consideration of firing Mr Mueller.
That may or may not be true. But the former FBI director is the person who Mr Trump fears most, and who fits the model of the kind of men he resented most during his turbulent days in the real estate game.
Mr Mueller is the ultimate establishment player, the ultimate upper-class Republican. Even his name sounds like what used to be called ""white shoe"" Robert Swan Mueller III.
He was appointed to his FBI position by George W Bush, himself a scion of an old-school Republican family. His original 10-year term was extended for two years by Mr Bush's successor, Barack Obama, making him the longest-serving FBI director since J Edgar Hoover.
His resume gleams with sterling credentials Princeton University and the University of Virginia. Service as an officer in the Marine Corps, where he was awarded a Bronze Star, among America's highest military honours, as well as a Purple Heart, given to soldiers wounded during action.
He has bounced between the private sector and public service, between San Francisco and Washington, Boston and New York.
Everything in his background is as much a contrast to Mr Trump's hustling, lying (by his own admission), adulterous (by his own admission) life.
When Mr Trump was rising in New York in the 1980s, the old money elite looked down on his arriviste persona.
Mr Trump, at the time, declared he didn't care, hanging his name from banners in full sight of city landmarks such as Grand Central Station, heading off to play golf at a country house before building his own golf courses.
And, as the Trump name appeared in more and more places, not just in New York, but across the United States and around the world, it seemed Mr Trump had triumphed over the old guard, which seemed to be less and less relevant as global billionaires became richer and richer.",19,26,24.692307692307693,0,0.7359116500616074,0.3734536561369896,0.12302510754058235,0.12116213352010961,0.0,0.44074582396927525,0.3891339954499176,0.11776915341615676,0.35798288540620554,0.21251615837721502,0.1811933784322066,0.05943551796178023,0.1948288139968849,0.03505271107905723,0.3036470555648421,0.06008028937562069,0.129353915967294,1.1064271380828943,0.22077745424628709,0.153209566728567,1.3135972983405815,0.2608323943718998,0.1527310524658218,1.3179261537383944,0.26168784389785316,0.0125,0.021052631578947368,0.03389830508474576,0.0192090395480226,3.2567724916833654,3.6556697040471593,0,0,1.1717256835045295,6.317908799928435,8.859179836719331,2.7315311885800786,0.356552108444699,-0.4233709874542085,,1.3450056807368544,-0.17807522385901217,-1.4642565102734864,-1.4870599002919156,-0.6381081815864973,0.789273971848031,0.0676067342812435,-1.593431362617633,-0.22337631818673448,-0.7703771684145744,-1.3164596778459505,-1.5984979123267158,-0.6063478603713468,-1.8596810727925202,-1.877673530179431,-1.8795805763956126,-1.092649308290163,-1.0773260608540995,-1.1234017196760588,-0.654173991290338,-0.6822947086678408,-0.8252928673805296,-0.7664023268404382,-0.5930359485126826,-0.7995808181545917,-0.628154461336735,-0.3977962962902469,-0.10300367154986693,-0.8596945706588728,1.4449898510752799,1.5023473385622281,,,0.44843034711108315,-0.1800361838656607,0.19948553846786457,0,-7.629284873926136
46,editorials_49.txt,"So, Vladimir Putin won his nation's presidential ""election"" race in a ""landslide"".
What a shock!
With no serious competitor and almost total control over the media, not even the Kremlin could suggest with a straight face this result was ever in doubt.
It is staggeringly easy to poke fun at a process with so many obvious democratic deficits.
The images of officials appearing to stuff ballot boxes in remote Russian regions are bizarre, not to mention the complaints from some citizens that they were forced to vote multiple times.
I find this particularly amusing considering how closely the ABC was supervised, monitored and checked when we entered a polling booth or filmed on the street.
Even an election coordinator in central Moscow confided to me in an awkward, embarrassed kind of way that ""irregularities"" and ""widespread voter fraud"" were fairly common.
It seems highly unlikely he was a Putin supporter they have spent the past 10 days claiming Russia's version of democracy is its own ""unique"" process that I can't comprehend due to my misguided, western ""Russophobic"" ways.
But to purely mock or focus on the broader geopolitical consequences of Vladimir Putin's ""re-election"" quote marks intended is to miss a few interesting aspects of this whole, theatrical process.
Russians, the many we met at least, seem to genuinely like voting, even though they almost all know the outcome has already been decided.
In their eyes, the fact they can actually cast a ballot puts them miles ahead of a stack of other countries.
Opposition supporters of course are campaigning for change.
But even had the banned and oft-arrested Alexei Navalny been allowed to run, it's highly unlikely he would have forced the election into a second round.
It's true, no-one knows for sure what would happen if Russia suddenly gave its people the freedom to openly, safely challenge the political establishment, though it's safe to say there's no sign that's about to happen.
And that seems at least partly because Mr Putin appears to have a solid support base.
Russians have repeatedly told us, ""they're not better off"", ""life isn't better"", but they think their President is carving out a greater place for them on the world stage and that makes them very proud.
So the ""election"", while flawed, serves a purpose it's almost a sort of ritual.
In the eyes of many Russians, the process, the show, legitimises Mr Putin's enormous power at home and licenses him to keep projecting it abroad.
Here, many expect him to keep antagonising and confronting Western nations for the next six years.",19,19,26.894736842105264,0,0.9783332943916321,0.9038904201217562,0.0,0.0,0.8947368421052632,0.4339000514612116,0.38202840238287045,0.0,0.25915160358960465,0.24879463395938792,0.20047017485001312,0.0,0.1616224026098558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10595897397367784,0.8677117245791064,0.17674160930508148,0.15991865285311652,1.3356893154244085,0.275107242722013,0.15290752160422233,1.3110749120518814,0.2609498234126749,0.0,0.11065162907268171,0.05172413793103448,0.014611338398597311,3.027139378741968,3.488953390484475,0,0,1.1192085046906068,5.842126080337107,8.664889386864246,2.7315311885800786,-0.541240970372888,0.052258599350291986,,3.134510418726499,4.173099595862843,-2.357799180792149,-2.4286777825002295,4.321808462363791,0.6350511981027639,-0.16547297471670092,-2.502611731142117,-2.070183283419609,0.2728251484446237,-0.5158657291434634,-2.360952611228986,-1.6034494773582333,-2.573735130227002,-2.6369220110038722,-2.6175076204565,-2.267210057343721,-2.6227753002516803,-2.5216539488524794,-0.050428154660496854,-0.28052691722286793,0.26307959828216854,-0.747108408134092,-0.7238116694575517,-0.8624025425660521,-1.0210577231409697,2.289244921671038,0.3817311904763855,-1.195490935305874,-0.6185863617954162,-0.26945106403810964,,,-0.6428189382208334,-1.7104688549757179,-0.5405029523777022,0,0.2441579898801015
47,editorials_5.txt,"The firing of Rex Tillerson occupied much of the news yesterday as shocked anchors recounted how the Secretary of State was effectively dispatched by a single Trump tweet. The shock, however, should not be over Twitter but torture. Once CIA Director Mike Pompeo replaces Tillerson, President Donald Trump wants Pompeo's second in command to take over the CIA: Deputy Director Gina Haspel.
Most people have no idea who Haspel is. She is, however, well-known to human rights advocates and civil libertarians around the world. Haspel was not simply a key figure in the torture program run by the Bush administration, she headed one of the infamous foreign black sites and was accused of knowingly destroying evidence of the torture carried out on her watch. 
After years of Congress and former Bush officials denouncing the torture program, the confirmation of Haspel would reaffirm that torture as not simply acceptable but a potential path to promotion in the United States. Trump has declared the possible confirmation of the agencys first female director as a historic milestone. Given her role in the torture program, however, Haspels confirmation would be equally historic and one milestone we would be wise to avoid.
The torture program approved by former president George W. Bush on Sept. 17, 2001, represented one of the most infamous moments in our history. The Justice Department memo used to justify the program was ultimately denounced by the Justice Departmentas seriously flawed and withdrawn. The program was ultimately closed as both Republicans and Democrats belatedly lined up to pledge to block any such program in the future. On Dec. 30, 2005, the Detainee Treatment Act was passed to reaffirm the long-established fact that waterboarding is torture and torture is a violation of not just international law but United States law.
The shocking accounts of the U.S. torture program destroyed the credibility of the United States and emboldened our enemies in China and other countries in their own use of torture. Among these shocking accounts, however, one CIA officer and one case stood out: Haspel and the torture of Abu Zubayda. Zubayda was the subject of one of the CIAs extraordinary rendition programs where suspects were taken to foreign locations were they were tortured. Haspel was the Chief of Base at the Thai torture site known as CIAs Cats Eye.
Zubayda was waterboarded 83 times in one month. He was denied sleep, forced into a small coffin-like box for long periods of time and physically abused, including having his head slammed into walls. The CIA reportedly got nothing from the torture but each session was carefully detailed by Haspel.
Accounts of the torture sessions describe fluid intake and involuntary leg, chest and arm spasms"" and ""hysterical pleas."" Zubaydah ""became completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth."" None of that mattered even when Zubaydah could no longer communicate and lost consciousness. There was only one person who could stop the sessions: chief of base Haspel ... and she didnt.",7,24,23.208333333333332,0,0.47739966764398245,0.3038362378483989,0.3285528621858075,0.36440395120353924,0.0,0.4370286788369687,0.41512546396930133,0.46162330146223585,0.41958266580713316,0.22770433402005233,0.19511969223492248,0.19740169736246269,0.20366948128647203,0.14872144568000997,1.2934613181151893,0.25605862114333705,0.15439678970503892,1.3334632496004548,0.2647937934131102,0.15237003804811747,1.3212658043584646,0.262145995720711,0.15397775610827016,1.3251080588457713,0.26314485400979926,0.013888888888888888,0.02414965986394558,0.0,0.01885369532428356,3.120053404452129,3.5480503296208656,0,0,1.0938975946686411,6.500308591881001,9.258751124199874,-0.10888252571463052,0.1000398002111027,-0.743845365144098,,-0.56327449219051,-0.7491471744451124,0.02851047382217019,0.4033066571239554,-0.6381081815864973,0.7055334689255668,0.9201863658143389,1.0611299717454743,0.9277056207519516,-0.3336350020138955,-0.7380792085742349,0.1713690860779727,-0.34088576189437364,0.4558494139134624,0.5972886384533357,0.52749356662637,0.16464709979179404,0.39251110093868397,0.2742311505997086,-0.729722573637205,-0.5428344359912056,-0.7251385607400561,-0.6300963475268756,-0.45594856185345006,-0.6755573126345743,-0.5844985433584867,-0.30491754889618045,-1.0247945567145438,-0.8856473880891218,0.216376727114482,0.3586090227215275,,,-1.1687518442978089,0.4066824784843716,1.72132129636787,0,1.4996350846880548
48,editorials_7.txt,"When we see the initials GOP, we think of the Republican nickname Grand Old Party. With Larry Kudlows appointment as the new director of the National Economic Council, those initials might soon become an acronym for Growth, Opportunity, and Prosperity.
Since his days working in Ronald Reagans budget office, Kudlow has been the happy warrior fighting for policies that would enable all of us to have better lives. He played an indispensable role in devising the 40th presidents economic revival program of promoting tax cuts, battling inflation, cutting regulations and reducing trade barriers. Not for him the pessimism of those who think were headed for long-term stagnation and or the defeatist thinking of those who believe we must go through austerity and grim times before we can ever prosper again.
Tax Cuts. Unlike all too many economists, Kudlow knows that taxes impose a financial burden on labor. They create a disincentive to hard work and risk-taking that is so critical to achieving success. Lower that burden through reductions in tax rates and we get more prosperity. Larry co-authored a book JFK and the Reagan Revolution: A Secret History of American Prosperity that chronicles how President John Kennedys historic, growth-igniting tax cuts came into being. The result was one of historys greatest economic booms.
We saw the same economic miracle materialize as a result of Ronald Reagans tax cuts tax cuts that Kudlow was instrumental in formulating and implementing.
Last year, Kudlow had another crucial hand in making tax cuts a reality this time advocating President Donald Trump's cuts. The historic bill that the president signed in December already is ginning up the kind of positive economic activity we havent seen in a generation.
Critics carp that that these tax reductions and Kudlow will be pushing hard to help make a reality President Trumps stated desire for more cuts are bad because they mean more budgetary red ink. Short-term, of course they do: new investments rarely bear fruit overnight! But Kudlow knows and history shows hes right that the only way we get some sanity in Washingtons finances is when the economy is booming.
Cutting unnecessary regulations. The cost to the US economy from rules and regulations comes to some $2 trillion. The president has made more progress in reducing these burdens than any other president in his first year in office. Kudlow will work hard to do more of the same.
Technology. Closely related to the subject of deregulation is making sure government doesnt hobble the development of exciting new technologies. One example is the deployment of next generation 5G broadband. This is a technology that has the potential to make possible billions upon billions of dollars in new economic activity. Nearly all of the investment will be made by the private sector, but government help is needed to clear red tape and minimize state and local regulatory roadblocks for the sake of national economic progress. Kudlow will be an advocate for just that policy.",8,27,20.444444444444443,0,0.47990229152716124,0.3111013406635583,0.3037504218518734,0.31248320583254097,0.1111111111111111,0.42195048419729114,0.3495542982298156,0.353467837959114,0.37785603415914004,0.2352274880700168,0.18819981172915534,0.19646086409205088,0.20858716377426345,0.1532688394513131,1.310521095993121,0.25862573059613025,0.1545158423187136,1.3398312945484445,0.2645370005839855,0.15609099432513446,1.3524819057240491,0.26727828429276024,0.15570537919879854,1.3478059297271854,0.2655000340070452,0.10092592592592592,0.06233072483072483,0.03389830508474576,0.0480225988700565,3.0327274611957904,3.4478796738287354,0,0,1.10846369780796,6.396770115483012,8.872359827562208,0.12781861714326193,0.4848082625614971,-1.3407260095528404,,-0.5448006578564039,-0.6895515080464693,-0.1516319313698159,-0.000198141599336907,-0.02217082057306287,0.36584923348493636,-1.2306978862114417,0.22616749376765125,0.14798251540742385,-0.11730364825469382,-1.0254721103088826,0.15929982560025033,-0.1932206286990331,0.5484837601079083,0.6399454342287064,0.5590236992200579,0.17062422626351886,0.43373797471641823,0.266077312601606,-0.3948763935724759,0.02486493050777647,-0.3338320171851173,-0.44120995205863767,-0.022694187792498117,-0.4750798574720174,2.1512723166117405,0.840118647726085,-0.10300367154986693,1.2447241721924591,-0.5683695882667188,-0.7059671073954114,,,-0.8660842220103979,0.07363409216940085,0.24968379340244065,0,2.3498373188259705
49,editorials_9.txt,"President Trump's tacky dismissal of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday was the right decision, if almost certainly for the wrong reasons and announced in the wrong way (by tweet). 
Tillerson, a lifelong oilman who had risen to chief executive of behemoth ExxonMobil, was an unorthodox choice last year to become America's chief diplomat, and he never quite rose to the challenge.
He earned his departure, effective March 31, because the State Department under his leadership was hollowed-out and demoralized as diplomatic crises burned in hot spots around the world.
Preoccupied with reorganizing the sprawling agency, Tillerson acquiesced to large budget cuts that Congress mostly and properly ignored. Failure to fill crucial positions left seven of nine administrative posts empty, a 60% vacancy rate among top-tier career diplomats and a free fall in new applications.
One crucial example of the brain drain: Just as Trump agreed to ascend the Everest of negotiations a face-to-face meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un there is no U.S. ambassador to South Korea, assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, or undersecretary of State for arms control and international security. And, oh yes, the chief U.S. envoy to North Korea just retired abruptly.
There's no evidence, however, that Tillerson was fired for his management failures. Rather, it was his frequent clashes with Trump on issues where Tillerson's pragmatic instincts were right, among them sticking with the Paris climate agreement and upholding the Iran nuclear deal. ""We disagreed on things,"" Trump told reporters after the firing.
Tillerson, who barely mentioned Trump in Tuesday's remarks at the State Department, never clicked with his impulsive boss and never recovered from the leaked comment that he had called Trump a ""moron.""
Trump, complaining to underlings that Tillerson's views were ""totally establishment,"" too often left his secretary of State looking foolish. The president once tweeted that Tillerson's bid to negotiate with Pyongyang was a waste of time then months later surprised him by agreeing to direct talks with Kim. The result was that foreign governments were never sure that America's chief diplomat spoke for America, or even the White House an unsustainable situation.
Trump's pick to succeed Tillerson, the more hawkish CIA Director Mike Pompeo, enjoys much better rapport with Trump. The choice was long rumored. But at his upcoming confirmation hearings, Pompeo, who has little diplomatic experience, deserves close scrutiny by the Senate for his controversial views on topics ranging from torture to the Russian investigation.
In addition, Pompeo should be asked about his strange decision, apparently at Trump's urging last year, to meet with a conspiracy theorist who argues that the theft of Democratic emails was an inside job rather than Russian malfeasance. Although personal chemistry is important, Trump and the nation would be ill-served by installation of a yes man in such a sensitive post.
The coming change offers an opportunity for a reset at State and the risk of a Trump foreign policy going even further off the rails.",11,20,29.0,0,0.6558658715925718,0.4504724721179197,0.2436381605538455,0.24628991249835852,0.2,0.37628091398316127,0.3890792046456604,0.20890562208923733,0.33593271519480783,0.20516554017861685,0.18087110674558335,0.11174991900722185,0.21067675230366112,0.09340972680313848,0.8211754499152991,0.16208187400364588,0.1478494599169572,1.2530847776398433,0.24875786409989953,0.15803174952465088,1.3580215869187524,0.26760546043207833,0.1589680284469866,1.3617481500312054,0.2719560164998781,0.0,0.0303030303030303,0.0,0.006802721088435374,3.1560406886133547,3.5817738278026496,0,0,1.1535690804921575,6.565851895192958,9.363843800872717,0.8379220457169393,-0.4129848162560899,0.5069045279134174,,0.7541248614012533,0.45371042052863503,-0.5882328136201095,-0.5146227961914556,0.4705790682376848,-0.6630029210207851,0.0658094705494864,-0.8898558866064082,-0.6354159799463326,-0.9817471836114949,-1.329844099020331,-0.9273948031891088,-0.13047575460783506,-0.6708981634316383,-0.5836295406430715,-0.6267615800771965,-0.16406654191282755,-0.12786102975951152,-0.23495117436872137,-0.2202292285378444,0.1256101666924132,-0.30888677834810946,-0.0844943816624816,0.24343332532963904,0.07446580029114512,-1.0210577231409697,-0.12038021631763877,-1.0247945567145438,-1.7657988392895383,0.539773046615997,0.7170097030851451,,,0.07115608164628069,0.6175131972781452,2.1215847744135603,0,-4.051923712134149
50,methods_0.txt,"Forty participants from the University of Essex took part in this experiment. There were five males and 35 females ranging from 18 to 39 years of age. The mean age was 20.8 years (standard deviation
4.2). All participants confirmed that they were fluent in English.
The materials consisted of a subset of 440 words that were randomly selected for each participant from the Toronto Noun Pool (Friendly, Franklin, Hoffman, & Rubin, 1982). Audio file versions of each word were obtained from Michael Kahanas Computational Memory Laboratory web site (Kahana, 2010; http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/WordPools). The shortest sound file was 0.350 s; the longest sound file was 0.860 s. Audio files were presented via a Logitech USB Headset 4.330 at a volume comfortable to each participant. The words were presented in 60-point Times New Roman font. The materials were presented on an Apple eMac computer monitor using the Supercard application.
The experiment used a mixed design. The betweensubjects independent variable was the task with two levels (ISR or IFR). There were three within-subjects independent variables: modality with two levels (visual and auditory), list length with seven levels (two, four, five, six, seven, eight, and 12), and serial position with up to 12 levels (serial position 112). The main dependent variables were the proportion of words recalled in any order (FR scoring), the proportion of words recalled in the correct serial position (SR scoring), and the probability of initiating recall with the very first list itemthat is, Probability of First Recall (PFR)
Serial Position 1.
Participants were tested individually and informed that they would be shown two practice lists, of seven words each, followed by 70 experimental lists of words. Participants were allocated to one of two groups: either the ISR group (where they should remember the words in the correct order), or the IFR group (where they can remember the words in any order). The two practice trials consisted of one visual trial and one auditory trial. The experimental trials were split into two equal blocks of 35 trials each. Each block consisted of only visual trials or auditory trials. The order of the blocks was counterbalanced across participants. In all conditions, the order of the list lengths was randomized, such that each block contained five repetitions of each list length. Participants were not aware of the length of the list in advance of its presentation.",6,23,20.26086956521739,0,0.5003224277699535,0.25880314870056487,0.2799812557382716,0.23853642039355777,0.0,0.5550594877165097,0.4873983123023965,0.49792053515002843,0.27945597521205673,0.36641500890254974,0.27255630671468556,0.3197716863027641,0.19104275017094335,0.14531793913706073,1.2038532696397415,0.24114607183195103,0.11390517280805411,0.9349021691977232,0.18830210171515685,0.1785436719523761,1.4052873061137228,0.2922393251533365,0.1613469594169975,1.3594493834784935,0.2719599240301904,0.10714285714285714,0.05586080586080586,0.19230769230769232,0.05128205128205128,3.1730502390623134,3.5547070418133426,0,0,1.1241496598639455,6.54302370561769,8.686529367398219,-0.345583668572523,-0.028216353905695445,-1.3803702559806876,,-0.39406357883913645,-1.1185537783206543,-0.32426957087070735,-0.5748794671771116,-0.6381081815864973,3.3645524052631193,3.2909011392302503,1.3413453876114019,-1.6907664201778076,3.6550468565378162,2.477978253299405,1.7411639877081533,-0.7200334471353678,0.38651704041982626,0.37322990503973874,0.3443324409539518,-1.8682651376435442,-2.187782770835565,-2.1545783470479276,1.6256239230111538,0.9851896039147149,1.5692992049912202,0.17560152609462695,0.19955473120462955,0.07479841679345084,2.3466845208953275,0.6460881402948201,4.204596041815835,1.482780591067044,0.6926277601566043,0.42935406126729836,,,-0.5401471616060831,0.5440826044682735,-0.45808337617513706,0,1.6433601078269076
51,methods_1.txt,"Thirty-three native British English speakers participated in the current experiment. However, only the data from 30 participants (23 females; mean age 24.8, range 18 401 ) were analysed: one participant was excluded for exceeding age requirements and two participants were excluded because of a software error, which prevented task completion. All participants reported that they had no language, hearing or vision impairments (other than corrected-to-normal vision) and had lived in the U.K. for the majority of their lives, speaking English as their first language from birth. Participants were recruited via the University College London online recruitment system or advertisements on the university campus and paid the standard rate at the time of 6/hour2 .
Sixty ambiguous words (e.g., bark, cabinet) were selected from a pretested set that had assessed dominance using a standard word association test (Warren, Vitello, Devlin & Rodd, in preparation; see the Appendix for ambiguous word list). These words had a dominance rating of 12 42% for the subordinate meaning (mean of 25%). In all cases the primed subordinate meaning had the same pronunciation and spelling as the dominant meaning, although in some cases there was an additional meaning with a different spelling (e.g., break/brake). Polysemous words were also included as long as the related meanings were judged by the author as sufficiently distinct that they could be distinguished on the basis of word association responses (e.g., typical associates related to the two related meanings of wave, disturbance in water or hand gesture, were deemed sufficiently distinct, whereas those to the two meanings of passage, corridor/tunnel or journey over time/distance, were not. Thirty-eight words were classed as polysemous; Parks, Ray, & Bland, 1998).
For the subordinate prime task, a total of 60 short paragraphs (mean length of 70 words) were composed in the style of a media or literature excerpt (see supplementary materials for paragraphs). Each paragraph contained at least one of the 60 ambiguous words, disambiguated towards the subordinate meaning3 . For the three repetition condition, the ambiguous word was used in the paragraph three times and was therefore massed in presentation (i.e., the three repetitions appeared in quick succession, within the same paragraph). The first presentation of the word always occurred in the first sentence, with the second and third repetitions distributed throughout the remainder of the paragraph, e.g.,The cabinet concluded that a referendum would be unnecessary, since the time it would use might only worsen the financial situation. The cabinet had been in talks for several weeks about a plethora of problems, but had only discussed the idea of a referendum over the last few days. Their decision was not a popular one, since previous cabinets held many referenda, which had proven popular with the public.
For the one repetition condition, the paragraphs were identical to the three repetition condition except that the second and third repetitions were replaced with a substitute word of a similar meaning. This was done to remove the instance of the ambiguous word itself without altering the global meaning or length of the paragraph. For example, the one repetition version of the passage above was created by replacing cabinet/cabinets in the second and third sentence with politicians. To fully control the number of repetitions, the ambiguous words did not appear anywhere in the experiment except for their respective priming paragraphs and in the test task. The paragraphs were spoken by a British English speaker (Jennifer M. Rodd) and were digitally recorded in a sound-proof booth. For each paragraph, we created a written summary sentence (mean length 8.8 words), and participants rated how well this sentence summarised the paragraph (to encourage close attention to the paragraph; see Procedure). The summary for a given item was the same for both the one and three subordinate prime conditions. All summaries were designed to be a similarly reasonable level of quality (as quality-judgment/relatedness was the task for the participants, as explained in the Procedure)",4,23,33.391304347826086,0,0.462129452011802,0.27723110766838427,0.43724697313847993,0.37422692226689486,0.08695652173913043,0.4696819415829819,0.44014198662662,0.46660905077156645,0.45177908395696303,0.26206614282624474,0.22584093459743043,0.2451867129308758,0.2416037877816471,0.15708368935382513,1.3297698501442379,0.2689694526902621,0.1647469144640374,1.3782898576472347,0.2792123816545058,0.16478364787357994,1.3755480268330265,0.27544836448342036,0.16339338417664132,1.375929991856267,0.2789557127973113,0.003703703703703704,0.01672362724994304,0.017543859649122806,0.013309134906231096,3.0606998069922935,3.4674580544632825,0,0,1.129846050939801,6.45673106985607,8.862845634259346,-0.8189859542883079,-0.028216353905695445,1.4552366332532412,,-0.6759959585407241,-0.9673891598705914,0.8179657981206253,0.47964639249297064,-0.15607024688033122,1.4411519468389598,1.7407855425599634,1.0996200624266053,1.5293427562997397,0.6544527823501053,0.5378195558764309,0.78436802857366,0.7981821700409018,0.6261955537905306,0.6880756139197712,0.686068897384621,0.684282937873559,0.6827196228512001,0.732058703971876,0.38736924938265377,0.44434788219987786,0.2890881080364043,0.3993434976885903,0.5141347067521476,0.6702934237683841,-0.904641941865641,-0.5276215553907285,-0.5477273442170356,-1.2905982910377405,-0.3169987530048705,-0.4978954268711831,,,-0.42178241256799587,0.2665082756670487,0.21344735692782404,0,3.066155129913629
52,methods_10.txt,"Female athletes from a varsity high school soccer team in California served as participants in the current case study. The roster listed 21 athletes, but due to injury, family obligations, academic deficiencies, and mandatory tutoring, only 18 participated in data collection. The athletes ranged in age from 14 to 17 years (mean = 16.28 years), and mostly identified themselves as Hispanic (N = 16). Other ethnicities identified included Black (N = 1) and White (N = 1). None of the athletes had previously participated in a formal sport psychology program or worked with a Sport Psychology Consultant (SPC).
The Head Coach (HC; white female) was also an important participant in the case study. She competed in soccer at both the community college and Division I levels. Though in her first year as HC of the varsity soccer program, she had formerly coached the varsity water polo and swim teams at the same school. When competing at the DI level, the HC had worked with a SPC and she was currently enrolled in a graduate program in Sport Psychology. Due to her strong connection to the study and the insights that she could provide, she joined the research team. She is the third author of the current manuscript, but is referred to as HC as her primary responsibilities were in this role.
The school is in one of the largest school districts within California. The schools Athletic Director (AD) promotes coach development and has an ongoing mission to increase student-athlete participation, engagement, achievement, and retention. Coaches meet with the AD each season (i.e., preseason, during season, postseason) to discuss how they can integrate these core values in their coaching. After a planning meeting with the AD, the HC contacted the first author to seek assistance with providing sport psychology services to her athletes. Ethical approval for the use of human subjects was obtained from the lead authors university as well as the school board.
During tryouts, once initial separation of teams (i.e., into Varsity, Junior Varsity, and Freshman) occurred, the HC led a discussion with the tentative Varsity team about the upcoming season, the mission to increase their engagement, and her decision to have them participate in a sport psychology/life skills curriculum (which will now be referred to as UNIFORM). She felt that the teams participation in UNIFORM would benefit her athletes individually as well as the team as a whole. She communicated this message in team meetings and during tryouts. Players were provided assent and consent forms in English or Spanish. The HC then hosted a parent-athlete meeting to review the upcoming season, at which time the decision to use UNIFORM was again discussed. She explained her decision to have the team participate in UNIFORM and identified potential benefits of this engagement. No parents objected to this decision.",4,23,23.608695652173914,0,0.46802211688323453,0.3124923560208836,0.4326886442800363,0.3735794895550325,0.08695652173913043,0.48084535343306406,0.48113256258475423,0.5465524461582985,0.5125235391380292,0.2876412073771159,0.2440048982538819,0.31503657208256475,0.2782554817930004,0.15097265032530044,1.2972506085949458,0.25932478853972524,0.17021082057369977,1.3743649739042771,0.2803526049516923,0.1611782899226532,1.3601997193681965,0.27393812911356213,0.16514084993873235,1.3676470387605777,0.2768391935556427,0.021241830065359478,0.03160014005602241,0.023809523809523808,0.019933554817275746,3.165493997912955,3.5692280494983755,0,0,1.1981009070294784,6.675269957555672,8.608701257255802,-0.8189859542883079,-0.028216353905695445,-0.6573843934938909,,-0.6324975665718201,-0.6781410037081728,0.7848582363984586,0.474614835179604,-0.15607024688033122,1.6926432632612505,3.085370213512756,1.7167847746664076,2.664441693252164,1.3898741628009084,1.2921959093235285,1.6804206778012465,1.89873660629366,0.50170840061094,0.6067634974629377,0.567609772411537,0.9586024747492892,0.6573098325647369,0.7682637494110757,0.0629256795695645,0.16522191696253327,0.1739416243113717,0.5903993540354648,0.3560306415031184,0.4901312315501732,-0.3533789775912898,-0.08148036846216354,-0.37734619689649695,-0.8067790840625201,0.6247243149835643,0.58367788039862,,,0.9964785186255748,0.9694742302330449,-0.7545050778728019,0,3.729537882188381

For the completion task the sentences such as (3) were truncated after the second or the third NP, yielding two accusative and two genitive conditions listed in Table 1. Across all sets, the critical second NP was an inanimate plural noun in order to avoid ambiguity between genitive and accusative forms found in other Russian nouns (see Footnote 2).4 Participants had to provide a natural completion for each sentence fragment (they were instructed to skip any fragments that they considered ungrammatical). If Russian speakers can resort to genitive-of-negation in order to license a genitive NP, continuations containing a negated embedded verb in both genitive conditions should be expected. The rate of such completions was predicted to be lower in the Gen-only condition than in the Gen+Dat condition, as the former also allows a completion with a monotransitive quirky verb that takes the genitive NP as a direct object. The two accusative conditions were used for estimating a baseline rate of negative completions in a case where either an affirmative or a negative continuation is available

54,methods_12.txt,"Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA; Smith, 1996) is rooted within, and combines both phenomenology (descriptive element) and hermeneutics (interpretive element; Pringle, Drummond, McLafferty, & Hendry, 2011). IPA reflects the authors views of constructivism in which the individual and the world are viewed as coconstructing rather than two separate bodies, wherein the researcher plays an interpretive part (Davidsen, 2013; Palmer, Larkin, De Visser, & Fadden, 2010). IPA was chosen as the qualitative approach for this study owing to the central position placed on an individuals lived experience and their resultant sense-making of these experiences (Smith & Eatough, 2012). Alternative means of data collection have begun to adopt methods of IPA, namely focus groups (Palmer et al., 2010; Tomkins & Eatough, 2010). Using an approach through which multiple perspectives of a given phenomenon can be shared is considered to uncover both implicit thoughts and subconscious opinion (Tomkins & Eatough, 2010). As a result, focus groups can build a deeper experiential understanding of a given phenomenon due to the dynamic interplay between participants (Liamputtong, 2011).
Supervisors associated with either the BPS or BASES, were identified via their accrediting bodys website, and emailed to request permission to contact their supervisees. Primary contact with supervisors was intended for recruitment of individuals from the same supervisory group. It was considered that participants sharing the same supervisor were likely to have had previous group reflections and would not therefore be averse to sharing knowledge and experiences in a discursive environment. In some instances supervisors did not run group supervision; however this method of contact enabled greater ease when organizing focus groups due to participants residing in relative proximity to each other.
In total 16 supervisors across England and Wales were initially contacted. Due to nonresponse, or difficulties organizing a suitable date and time for all individuals, the final participant sample represented eight supervisory groups. All participants were enrolled on a training program toward either chartered psychologist (BPS) or an accredited sport and exercise scientist (BASES). The final sample of participants represented a homogenous group to align with IPA guidelines (Smith & Eatough, 2012). Across the sample were minor discrepancies between participants, including group and individual supervision, as well as variation in the stage of training, i.e., at the start, middle, and end of this process. Following institutional ethical approval and informed consent, the sample included seven males (age: M = 31.71 years, SD = 9.32 years), and 12 females (age: M = 25.33 years, SD = 1.37 years), creating five focus groups, comprising between three to five participants. Liamputtong (2011) and Litosseliti (2003) advise that smaller participant numbers in focus groups elicit greater contribution from each member, allowing for better articulation of opinion.
A natural human behavior is to discuss perceptions and opinions of specific topics in a group setting; consequently focus groups appeal to the ordinary conversation and social interaction of everyday life (Colucci, 2007; Litosseliti, 2003). Heightened interaction and sense making between participants therefore create opportunity to uncover implicit perceptions regarding observation experiences (Liamputtong, 2011; Tomkins & Eatough, 2010). To align with the principles of IPA, the researcher adopted the role of a moderator and ensured that focus groups were participant-led (Smith & Eatough, 2012). Through assuming a position as moderator, the researcher can actively engage participants and encourage discussion between group members, rather than between moderator and participant (Liamputtong, 2011).",4,22,30.681818181818183,0,0.5198031919343131,0.38815882573009053,0.4725707992911339,0.47173134574577924,0.2727272727272727,0.37751275215608376,0.35294369830536115,0.36071422403660036,0.3610031705618694,0.24264195999293997,0.19214531466200344,0.20089245907752318,0.198686959889029,0.1558895554889563,1.3172346601583813,0.26589266902611136,0.15780775439282926,1.3421860652612365,0.2703860431860644,0.1608922134108664,1.3552141614219282,0.2741970021824872,0.15890146469401067,1.349186503882676,0.2716183786945876,0.0196078431372549,0.019237502693385047,0.017857142857142856,0.017543859649122806,2.9822660720093563,3.4051109570180835,0,0,1.170734631473114,6.26847828050826,8.552751396935538,-0.8189859542883079,-0.1564725080224936,0.8701046276632783,,-0.25026074362561923,-0.05744866100056419,1.074525996151483,1.237407138979755,0.8737380681737509,-0.6352518528090334,-1.119517809357693,0.28210974836736785,-0.16693787521662026,0.09590250674928774,-0.8616095211024999,0.21614950969786134,-0.49049783783229906,0.6018700136231411,0.6567322375254134,0.6482787685737085,0.3358971605861098,0.44898281606798995,0.45179957744798555,0.037181859957997415,0.07455402558834426,0.19367915940871835,-0.09177200340613118,0.003658054437922152,0.04572542034122042,-0.40473888109511136,-0.452231348777962,-0.5392082868510086,-0.9813121657049768,-1.0218360812289522,-1.1604969761708943,,,0.427837374574594,-0.3390375068551856,-0.9675997139307944,0,5.442707400016481
55,methods_13.txt,"Participants were recruited in three ways: (1) online (n = 298), from three OCD-related websites (International ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder Foundation, the Houston OCD Program, and the Peace of Mind Foundation); (2) a residential treatment facility (n = 127), the Houston OCD Program; and (3) in person at consumer conferences of the International OCD Foundation (n = 100). All participants completed a battery of measures, including demographic information and assessments for OCD severity. The residential treatment center used in the current study utilizes a structured diagnostic interview at the onset of treatment, the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; Sheehan et al., 1998), as well as expert clinical assessments conducted by licensed clinicians specializing in the treatment of OCD. The results of the online and consumer conferences were aggregated across two separate studies. Not all participants completed all of the measures of OCD severity because of responses being collected from separate studies requiring completion of differing measures from their participants (see Table 1). Participants in the online and residential treatment groups were asked to complete the Y-BOCS-SR, the OCIR, and the DOCS, while the conference group was given only the Y-BOCS-SR and the DOCS. Of the original 575 participants recruited, 525 met criteria for study inclusion. Participants were excluded if they were under that age of 18 or did not complete both the WHOS and at least one OCD severity measure. Demographic information is displayed in Tables 2 and 3. Participants were primarily female (60.1%), with a mean age of 34.0 (SD = 12.7; range 1880). Participant race/ethnicity was 82.7% White, 4.4% Hispanic American, 3.6% Asian/Pacific Islander, 1.9% African American, and 7.5% Other or Withheld.
Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive ScaleSelf-Report (YBOCS-SR). The Y-BOCS-SR (Steketee, Frost, & Bogart, 1996) is a 10-item self-report scale measuring OCD severity. Items are rated on a 5-point scale from 0 to 4, assessing for time burden, interference, distress, resistance, and control over both obsessions and compulsions. Total scores range from 0 to 40, with scores at or above 16 commonly used as the clinical cutoff for OCD. The Y-BOCS-SR displays good psychometric properties (Steketee et al., 1996).
Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R). The OCI-R (Foa et al., 2002) is a shortened, 18-item version of the original OCI (OCI; Foa, Kozak, Salkovskis, Coles, & Amir, 1998), measuring OCD severity. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = Not at all to 4 = Extremely). Total scores range from 0 to 72, with scores at or above 21 considered indicative of the likely presence of OCD. The OCI-R displays good psychometric properties.
Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS). The DOCS (Abramowitz et al., 2010) is a 20-item self-report scale that assesses OCD severity dimensionally, including contamination, responsibility for harm and mistakes, symmetry/ordering, and unacceptable thoughts. Each subscale consists of 5 items rated 0 to 4 that assess time burden, avoidance, distress, life interference, and difficulty in disregarding or refraining from obsessions and/or compulsions.

56,methods_14.txt,"An archival sample of 402 subjects was used in this study. Table 1 presents the characteristics of this sample. As may be seen from the table, the sample is balanced among African-American (36%), Latino (16%), and Caucasian (48%) subjects. Gender balance is 52% female and 48% male.
The following criterion measures were obtained from subjects case files: ever diagnosed psychotic, ever diagnosed depressed, ever diagnosed with bipolar disorder, ever diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and ever diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. All diagnoses were made by examining psychologists or psychiatrists, documented in professional reports on the subjects. Criteria relating to events in the case history include: ever hospitalized for psychiatric treatment, number of arrests, ever incarcerated in a county jail, and history of violent behavior (including domestic violence, assault/aggravated assault, or homicide). Additionally, in the item development phase, individual items were correlated with either the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI)-III scales or Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) scales cited below. For subjects who had been administered both instruments, only one was employed as a criterion variable.
All records were selected from files accumulated in private forensic psychology practice. All subjects had presented for a psychological evaluation relating to a legal matter. The most common case type was child protective services matters, followed by criminal matters, followed by assessments for professional boards, followed by tort cases. Criteria for case selection in the item development phase included at least one psychological or psychiatric evaluation containing a diagnostic section, adequate case material to document criminal history, drug use, child abuse and other factors, and administration of either the MCMI-III or PAI and the House-Tree-Person as part of an evaluation. Criteria for the cross-validation sample included at least one psychological or psychiatric evaluation containing a diagnostic section, adequate case material to document criminal history, drug use, child abuse and other factors, and administration of the House-Tree-Person. Intellectually disabled subjects were not included in either sample.
One hundred and sixty subjects in the item development sample had been administered the PAI (Morey, 1991) as part of a psychological examination. The main psychopathology scales (as opposed to subscales) and two PAI impression management scales measuring fake-bad and fake-good response sets were recorded for these subjects. Ninety-two subjects in the item development sample had been administered the MCMI-III (Millon, 1997), also as part of a psychological examination. All scores on the MCMI-III were recorded for these subjects.

57,methods_15.txt,"The purpose of the current study was to understand the lived experiences of grieving companion animal owners. Therefore, a qualitative research design utilizing a phenomenological perspective was employed. Institutional review board approval was obtained prior to commencing the research.
The term companion animal is used in this study to refer to domesticated animals who are cared for by and in close relationship with humans. For this study, owners of cats and dogs and one horse participated. Horses are primarily considered livestock, but secondarily also may be considered as companion animals. Participants were recruited from two Midwestern University locations through a companion animal loss support group and an organization within a University Foundation that assists with the memorialization of individuals former companion animals. Eleven qualitative interviews were conducted with 10 individual interviews and one couple interview. There were seven female and five male participants, all identifying as Caucasian. The age range was from 44 to 91 years (M 61.83 years). The education level of participants included one doctorate, two masters, four bachelors, and one associates degree, three with some college and one with a high school education. The type of animal loss discussed in the interviews included six dogs, five cats, and one horse.
Participants were invited to complete a semistructured interview regarding their experience with the loss of a companion animal. An interview guide was used to elicit responses. Interviews occurred via phone and in person. The structure of each interview was informed by the research questions. The research questions included the following content areas, as related to the participants experience with companion animal loss: (a) description of and relationship with companion animal (and animals in general), (b) circumstances of the loss, (c) experience with veterinarian, (d) responses of support system (family and friends), and (e) experience of grief and healing process. While participants were given no incentive to participate, many reported at the end of the interview gratitude for the opportunity to share the story of their loss about their beloved animals.
A retroductive analytic strategy (Burr, 1973) was utilized to concurrently acknowledge the existing literature and the new information provided by participants. Retroduction involves the usage of both deductive and inductive strategies. Deduced hypotheses from the existing literature and theory were used to initially analyze the data. This supports the usage of the interview guide which was developed based upon the researchers clinical expertise in conducting therapy with grieving companion animal owners and the existing literature on companion animal loss. In addition, the coders inductively analyzed the transcripts allowing for new themes to emerge, while still viewing those new themes within the original deductive framework. This analytic strategy was deemed most appropriate for this research as it permits usage of existing literature as the basic framework from which to view the data but also offers flexibility for new themes to emerge so that gaps in the literature can be filled.",4,24,22.666666666666668,0,0.4094950232816779,0.3115717673343539,0.3688204726204276,0.3363902229582891,0.0,0.34234266712377637,0.37515203718880014,0.41223000253452674,0.38325590110775387,0.2258745611850488,0.22104307263142475,0.24683429102616428,0.23290009358010832,0.1823582334299376,1.4577542081446941,0.30087802258624435,0.18249723241072716,1.4573722112897465,0.30033686195617876,0.17831244862363194,1.4392232391681186,0.2943971815502291,0.17643687315690595,1.4335369943675562,0.29254163452062826,0.03414786967418546,0.0273992673992674,0.03389830508474576,0.02711864406779661,3.0682643093016115,3.507444002518428,0,0,1.1827198952198952,6.641581091581092,8.456367540648325,-0.8189859542883079,0.1000398002111027,-0.8608219738473184,,-1.0645320558609321,-0.6856925962525084,0.3209778317660486,0.1855964972193049,-0.6381081815864973,-1.427569748291298,-0.3910334850462833,0.6798126537628378,0.2488869224810525,-0.38625086390362945,0.3385572317100671,0.805503600427664,0.5368330148743296,1.1410598878687421,1.008091657547724,1.077981068718252,1.5754510693906971,1.1947006528681456,1.4028157136635115,1.604816301903091,1.6023521211332268,1.7338229484055168,1.8254286382028695,1.6137306091587158,1.8267532341918957,0.05228702715130055,-0.20746300549888488,-0.10300367154986693,-0.28201099418987985,-0.24902106970055612,-0.07293977990068379,,,0.6768779893519097,0.8611085014725883,-1.3346941563444497,0,3.1554145544542873

59,methods_17.txt,"Sixteen undergraduates recruited from the subject pool at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Tsukuba, Japan) participated for pay in this and the following Experiments 25. All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and normal colour vision.
In this and the following experiments, stimuli were displayed on a CRT monitor controlled by a computer using MATLAB software and the Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997; Kleiner, Brainard, & Pelli, 2007; Pelli, 1997) at a viewing distance of approximately 60 cm. The stimuli were adapted from those used in a typical temporal letter-search task with peripheral distractors (Folk et al., 2002; Leber & Egeth, 2006). The stimulus sequences consisted of letters selected randomly from the English alphabet, excluding I, O, Q, and Z, with the constraint that the letter selected was not one of the two immediately preceding items in both streams and that the two concurrently presented letters differed from each other. One stream was presented 1.2 above the centre of the screen, and the other steam was presented 1.2 below the centre. The letters appeared in BorisBlackBloxx font and subtended a visual angle of approximately 1.0 in height and 0.81.2 in width (stroke = 0.2). The target colour was chosen from among blue (RGB palette value: 0, 0, 255), orange (255, 102, 0), magenta (255, 153, 204), cyan (0, 204, 255), dark yellow (128, 128, 0), purple (128, 0, 128), and red (255, 0, 0). Two colours were chosen from the rest for the non-target items in the two streams: one colour for the top stream and the other for the bottom. The distractor frame consisted of six hash signs (i.e., #) of the same height as the letters, flanking both streams and the central fixation point (2.0 to the right and left, see Figure 1). One of the hash signs in the middle row (right or left side, determined randomly on every trial) was yellow (255, 255, 0), green (0, 255, 0), or the same colour as the target. The other hash signs in the distractor frame were grey (128, 128, 128). All stimuli were presented on a black background.
Observers were instructed to maintain fixation at the centre of the screen and to identify an oddballcoloured target that appeared unpredictably and with equal probability in either the top or the bottom stream. Each trial started with a 500-ms fixation display of a dot (0.1 0.1) in the centre of the screen once the observers pressed the space bar. Two rapid sequences of 20 letters appeared simultaneously above and below the fixation point following a 500- ms blank interval (Figure 1). Target colour was assigned randomly from seven possible colours (blue, orange, magenta, cyan, dark yellow, purple, and red were used for half of the observers; green was used instead of red for the other half). The colour of the target and that of non-target items in the two streams differed from each other. The colours were randomly assigned during every trial. As a result, observers were forced to adopt the singleton-detection mode for each stream because they were not informed of the target colour for every trial. The target was chosen randomly from the letters, and the nontargets were chosen from the remaining letters without selecting the same letter in successive frames. The temporal position of the target varied randomly from item 12 to 15 of the stream. Each item was presented for 67 ms, followed by a 50-ms blank interval before the next item was presented, resulting in 117 ms of stimulus onset asynchrony. The onsets and offsets of the items in the two streams were synchronized. Following the study by Folk et al. (2002), a distractor frame, when present, preceded the target frame by two frames (233 ms). The side on which the oddball-coloured distractor (singleton) appeared was determined randomly from trial to trial.
The critical independent variable was the type of distractor. Under the same-colour condition, the distractor singleton was the same colour as the target of that trial. Under the different-colour condition, the colour of the distractor singleton (green, yellow, or grey) differed from the target. No distractor was presented under the distractor-absent condition, which served as a control. Observers were required to ignore the distractors and identify the target letter by pressing a corresponding key on the keyboard after all stimuli were presented. When an incorrect response was made, an alarm sounded through headphones. The same number of trials (120 trials) was assigned for each of the three conditions, and the trials were randomly ordered throughout the experimental session. Observers participated in 24 practice trials before the start of the experimental trials. To familiarize observers with the procedure, practice began at a very slow presentation rate, with the rate gradually increased to full speed for practice trial 12. The accuracy scores for the practice trials were excluded from analyses in this and the following experiments.",4,38,26.36842105263158,0,0.4313244257827063,0.30414787084818057,0.347364686112547,0.2827212108291176,0.02631578947368421,0.4595070711189979,0.43881720358917076,0.46743707970642145,0.42775403684557295,0.3204415861125055,0.27239475329899915,0.29261782441761286,0.26566235975102603,0.19231577758425486,1.5213563247767035,0.31177736429838376,0.17161411005849636,1.4125051285326788,0.28578837606569474,0.18672551152935632,1.487848249926783,0.30395600053342736,0.18222738312861647,1.4760673750996771,0.3012827921431996,0.056706349206349205,0.024747430206465394,0.06578947368421052,0.03383458646616541,3.241581545796869,3.6274476971227068,0,0,1.1487786195286196,6.62146719286005,9.209463729014757,-0.8189859542883079,1.8956259578462766,-0.06140288279048956,,-0.9033920746887348,-0.7465908477466047,0.16514248109987859,-0.23149504840699578,-0.4922282802938418,1.2119306655874962,1.697329628051422,1.1060124634102497,1.080399632930168,2.333062390572858,2.4712687003121,1.3928269949862229,1.5205981135605773,1.343903679021928,1.16712435536277,1.2118505805903472,1.0290556842016327,0.9042300967228543,0.9408635732045019,2.3619017839406475,2.4866517804793378,2.4626261644119714,2.458523068623325,2.4255456722956446,2.570817398033761,0.7613510423137967,-0.2869906345985299,0.7642074901511118,0.20849262256494178,1.3084778551316476,1.2024144422645926,,,-0.02838443482725952,0.7964088676302281,1.5336018011073125,0,-2.38808327375511
60,methods_18.txt,"Five participants (2 female; average age 26 years and 5 months) took part in Experiment 1. Two participants had corrected-to-normal vision.
A stimulus display consisting of a pair of identical horizontally oriented black-filled equilateral triangles was presented against a white background with stimuli centred with the reference to the monitor screen (see Figure 4). The area of each triangle was 173 mm2 (side = 20 mm, height = 17.3 mm), with eight equidistant increments from 4 mm to 32 mm between triangles. This led the shortest display to subtend a horizontal visual angle of 3, and the longest, 512 , from a viewing distance of 80 cm. The vertical visual angle was approximately 124 . The average luminance of the background was 0.0359 cd cm2 , and the value for the stimulus was 0.00002 cd cm2 . The experiment was controlled by Superlab experimental software. Experiment 1 and all subsequent experiments were run from a Dell Latitude notebook connected to a 19-inch Mitsubishi Diamond Plus 91 monitor. The horizontal length of the monitor was 341 mm, and the maximum length of the stimulus in Experiment 1 was 66.6 mm, or under 20% of the overall length. The length of the unused space on each side was 137 mmover twice the length of the stimulus.
The order of presentation was randomized in advance within four 24-trial blocks using random number tables. There were two levels of aspect (vertex, base) and eight levels of distance (4 to 32 mm), resulting in 16 conditions.
Participants were tested in a sound-attenuated room, with constant low-level ambient illumination provided by a ceiling light. The participants were shown an example of an experimental display (minimum and maximum distance) and were instructed to estimate verbally the distance between the two triangles using the category scaling method, which produces reliable subjective judgment functions (Stevens, 1975, p. 146). Participants were shown examples of the minimum and maximum distance in both configurations (bases and vertices) for 2 s each and instructed as follows:",4,16,24.4375,0,0.4628171145915985,0.35584642812609674,0.4176201019436121,0.4012263494854172,0.0,0.45572926619878185,0.40808698242036706,0.45877774332960447,0.4083499971777201,0.21667313790665224,0.22417478035190846,0.2500504043662832,0.22841223390829382,0.16077942003684978,1.3674386679689217,0.2736686367856622,0.15851612823164102,1.364045435682132,0.27114796380142153,0.15364275531721813,1.3308690590882253,0.2689488338518731,0.15472162330453432,1.3318925367057837,0.2649524161156922,0.019047619047619046,0.01818181818181818,0.0,0.02849002849002849,3.2672031572811457,3.636369268507876,0,0,1.1692396682122053,6.817629886810797,9.071897913213611,-0.8189859542883079,-0.9260094327232825,-0.47839844539448123,,-0.6709197804292978,-0.322507383105611,0.6754140275757149,0.6894738587130413,-0.6381081815864973,1.126823608235245,0.6893080681503346,1.0391622024558236,0.717806788300824,-0.6508415317414573,0.4686216986361235,0.8467607613386325,0.40207433579212015,0.7014807858927499,0.7822638900242186,0.7437859134818109,0.37146160468482636,0.5905008977654963,0.47599253208076214,-0.6151916616528217,-0.36818861579201845,-0.20646252799197898,-0.5487670378066473,-0.326447221224319,-0.5216941465659771,-0.4223479908678502,-0.48389094179898734,-1.0247945567145438,-0.18185096017449878,1.5387240392168715,1.2972295541821466,,,0.39677368023860654,1.4273981476382438,1.0096588049252748,0,-1.6448480320729195
61,methods_19.txt,"We conducted a cross-sectional study using nonprobability convenience sampling methodology. We approached AYA who were 1222 years old, had SCD patients (all genotypes), were English-speaking and on a steady state dose of hydroxyurea, defined as a stable dose for 2 months or more prior to enrollment in the study. Between January 2015 and December 2015, patients were enrolled before or after their scheduled outpatient comprehensive sickle cell clinic or hydroxyurea clinic appointments. Exclusion criteria included patients with SCD on chronic transfusion support, with any haemoglobin disorder other than SCD, or with any cognitive or physical disability.
We evaluated patients perceptions using the brief illness perception questionnaire (B-IPQ), which was adapted to reflect hydroxyurea and SCD [28]. In the adapted B-IPQ, we replaced the word illness by sickle cell disease and the word treatment by Hydroxyurea. For example, one of the questions was How much do you think your hydroxyurea can help your sickle cell disease? instead of How much do you think your treatment can help your illness? In addition, two items were deemed not applicable and/or could be confusing for patients with SCD, and therefore were deleted in the adapted B-IPQ version. The B-IPQ has been extensively utilized in earlier studies and used in patients as young as 8 years of age [27, 28]. The adapted B-IPQ consists of 7 items or dimensions including perceived consequences of SCD, personal control of SCD, control of SCD with hydroxyurea, identity (i.e. SCDrelated symptoms), concerns about SCD, understanding of SCD, and emotional response secondary to having SCD. The Identity domain will be referred to as symptoms throughout the manuscript. Each item uses a scale from 0 to 10 to assess each dimension, and each item is evaluated as a separate subscale. Higher scores indicate stronger perceptions of each dimension of the B-IPQ. In particular, higher B-IPQ scores indicate more negative perceptions of SCD-related consequences, identity (i.e. more perceived symptoms), concerns, and emotional response, but more positive perceptions of personal control, treatment control, and understanding of SCD.
Study participants were asked to complete Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Computerized Adaptive Testing (PROMIS-CAT) measures using an electronic tablet [29]. PROMIS-CAT is a novel application of a comprehensive, item-response theory optimized item bank, which enables precise estimation of a PRO domain while simultaneously minimizing burden to participants [30, 31]. In CAT, items administered are selected based on informants previous item responses, using a pre-set computerized algorithm based on individual item information functions. Therefore, the total number of items used in different PROMIS measures vary within and in-between patients. A number of PROMIS measures have been validated in the paediatric and adult populations [3235], and have been recently evaluated in SCD [36, 37]. Adolescents (age 1217 years) were asked to complete paediatric PROMIS-CAT measures of fatigue, pain interference, physical functioning mobility and upper-extremity, depression, anxiety, and peer relationships. Young adults (age 1822 years) were asked to complete adult PROMIS-CAT measures of fatigue, pain interference, physical functioning mobility and upper-extremity, depression, anxiety, and social isolation. PROMIS peer relationships and social isolation measures have different set of questions, however both evaluate patients relationships and social support. All paediatric and most adult PROMIS- CAT measures elicited participants responses based on the previous 7 days using 5-point response options ranging from with no trouble to not able to do for physical functioning measures and from never to almost always in all other measures. No timeframe was assigned to adult PROMIS physical functioning measure. Higher PROMIS domain scores indicated better physical functioning (mobility or upper-extremity), and peer relationships, but worse severity for fatigue, pain interference, depression, anxiety, and social isolation. PROMIS-CAT paediatric and adult measures were scored on a general population based T-score metric with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 [32, 38].
Hydroxyurea adherence was evaluated using the Modified Morisky Adherence Scale 8-items (MMAS-8), which was adapted to reflect hydroxyurea and SCD. In the adapted MMAS-8, we replaced the words medicine, medication and pills with Hydroxyurea. MMAS-8 includes 7 yes/no questions and 1 multiple choice question, and evaluates adherence over the past day and 2 weeks [39, 40]. Total MMAS-8 numerical scores were calculated per the assessment manual. Higher MMAS-8 scores indicated better adherence to hydroxyurea. Based on the total MMAS-8 score, three levels of adherence were also considered: low (0 to <6), medium (6 to <8) and high (8).",4,33,27.515151515151516,0,0.4970077881589532,0.3227596373339607,0.4423587756852309,0.4048459387525465,0.0,0.4068404929712415,0.3762548414078296,0.4148126326318197,0.38158309420203795,0.2815684882458299,0.24857841902240008,0.2934371893351248,0.25947705529816484,0.16458494962584944,1.3561760958967877,0.2754304829871234,0.16786864979165725,1.383714370769645,0.2799083046137097,0.16781859270398577,1.396658316762286,0.28269819671475255,0.17036409587821733,1.3987417714864694,0.2842334865483203,0.057060755336617405,0.030356948905336002,0.038461538461538464,0.03700097370983447,3.0378079858208245,3.472265741870883,0,0,1.1499471542949804,6.4391498087079855,8.8435591867279,-0.8189859542883079,1.254345187262286,0.18624137678291003,,-0.4185315396311942,-0.5939184555181594,0.8550932901431886,0.7176036867472477,-0.6381081815864973,0.02544867892324855,-0.3548589836320175,0.6997506130289789,0.21762808025841845,1.2152506549017577,1.4821410107906234,1.4033380269902576,1.3348696107235272,0.7790027167238206,0.7541026067868862,0.7654255222960408,0.8410120199869778,0.717838049248909,0.7541560619388028,0.6604817525973622,0.8282618783487699,0.8418447880184623,1.1614730468810999,0.9495633580355824,1.119547685337905,0.7724908282806601,-0.11876321712274918,0.02108356299153193,0.4397519608587355,-0.5227139350778879,-0.4468011296968053,,,-0.00410356602440842,0.2099552834031476,0.13999161469648116,0,2.390217823640962
62,methods_2.txt,"Sixty-two healthy participants (39 females; age range 1857; Mage 27.16, SD 7.83) were recruited from the University College London (UCL) Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience Subject Database. Sample size was determined by an a priori power analysis in G Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007). The power analysis was based on the main finding from the reinforced go/no-go task showing that participants are significantly slower to respond in the punished conditions relative to the rewarded conditions, with a Cohens dz (within-subjects) effect size of 0.487 (Crockett et al., 2009). Detecting an effect size of this magnitude using a paired t test requires 57 participants at the 0.05 alpha level (two-tailed) with 95% power. The present study recruited 62 participants to allow for a small number of unusable data sets.
Due to a recording fault during the sustained attention to response task (SART), one female participant was excluded, resulting in 61 participants in the SART. Participants reported no history of psychiatric, neurological or substance use disorders and no pacemaker implantation. Participants provided written informed consent and were reimbursed 7.50/hr for participation. To incentivize performance, participants were also informed that they could receive additional financial compensation based on task performance. The study obtained ethical approval from the UCL Research Ethics Committee (Project ID Number: 1764/001) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Data and materials for the tasks are freely available for download (https://figshare.com/articles/SART_script/3443093 and https://dx .doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3291299.v1).
The ToS procedure is identical to Mkrtchian, Aylward, Dayan, Roiser, and Robinson (2017). Anxiety was induced with the ToS paradigm where unpredictable electric shocks were delivered with two electrodes attached to the nondominant wrist using a Digitimer DS5 Constant Current Stimulator (Digitimer Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, U.K.). A highly unpleasant but not painful (Schmitz & Grillon, 2012) subjective shock level was established using a shock work-up procedure prior to testing. No more than five (to avoid habituation) shocks with a gradually increasing shock level were administered. Participants rated each shock on a scale from 1 (barely felt it) to 5 (unbearable) to reach a shock level of 4. The reinforced go/no-go task was programmed in Psychtoolbox (http:// psychtoolbox.org) and the SART in Cogent (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging and Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UCL, London, U.K.) using MATLAB (Release 2014a, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, United States).
Both tasks were presented on a laptop and administered under alternating safe and threat blocks. During the safe block, the background color was blue and the block was preceded by a 4000ms message stating, You are now safe from shock. During the threat block, the background color was red and the message, Warning! You are now at risk of shock was presented for 4,000 ms at the beginning. Participants were told that they might receive a shock only during the threat condition but that the shocks were not dependent on their performance. At the end of each experimental task, participants retrospectively rated how anxious, stressed and afraid they felt during the safe and threat conditions on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 10 (very much so). Numerous previous studies have implemented this questionnaire to assess effectiveness of the threat condition (Robinson, Vytal, et al., 2013). The reinforced go/no-go task and SART were administered together with a third task (the third task was part of a larger study including a patient group and are published separately: Mkrtchian et al., 2017). All experimental tasks were administered in a counterbalanced order across participants.",4,29,24.655172413793103,0,0.36793725247428355,0.2418654223307887,0.31668069671140986,0.2804018234580078,0.06896551724137931,0.4092885398357693,0.3697639611345822,0.44677038739703606,0.3719524925526481,0.2590267904221065,0.21695564936621056,0.2487922465718727,0.22731784768301586,0.15300923689577323,1.31068377756087,0.2612509048278274,0.1587314784833153,1.3467618734137954,0.2701599471696064,0.15931894804922073,1.3586869711803813,0.2724361249885475,0.15939479631870232,1.3536481051772926,0.2711728704877851,0.021929824561403508,0.030403297682709447,0.04838709677419355,0.02867383512544803,3.1151092924359456,3.5232682836721487,0,0,1.131908915999825,6.34904243717375,8.715157274475809,-0.8189859542883079,0.7413205707950934,-0.43139060396599865,,-1.3713026330742362,-1.2574940130243437,-0.057718155885252385,-0.24952028913984117,-0.2558022333712621,0.08059871162754495,-0.5677747066341098,0.9464651593413104,0.037666211115800145,0.5670549681126567,0.1688004805886274,0.8306207771136168,0.36921278197606766,0.5431954314053005,0.6403522082477784,0.5912670036560577,0.38227342687205185,0.4786067063949928,0.44462044282612434,-0.10439515878556462,0.1377109162184754,0.05942272415333702,-0.03783452545195816,0.08882059176610255,0.007802904160613909,-0.33175375506336496,-0.11737323421347313,0.2909875938834223,-0.1684265121806154,0.1719469329106811,0.09523474046452843,,,-0.37891834268976665,-0.07988976482033018,-0.34904908359815395,0,2.3323662830031493
63,methods_20.txt,"After receiving university Institutional Research Ethics Board approval, the authors used their connections with various national sport associations and national sport centers to gain a list of potential immigrant athletes who would be suited to the study and extend an initial recruitment invitation for the athletes to participate. This recruitment process was initiated through posted invitations to participate by Skype, with follow-up e-mails sent to the coaching fraternity of nationally accredited coaches and to executive directors from national sport organizations. When a positive response was received from immigrant athletes by their coaches, the athletes contact information was forwarded to the first author. Either the first or second author then followed up with the athletes to provide information about the project.
Participants were 24 national- and international-level athletes who had immigrated to Canada during their teenage years and early adulthood. At the time of the interviews, the participants had been living in Canada for an average of 8.6 years. The participants relocated to Canada for nonsport reasons, though all but two were recognized athletes within their home countries before relocation. Hence, these athletes embarked on their acculturation processes during adolescence and continued onward in this process into adulthood. Eighteen of the participants were male, and six were female. At the time of the study the athletes ranged in age from 18 to 32 years (M = 23 years). Participants came from 10 sports: boxing (n = 6), swimming (n = 5), badminton (n = 2), judo (n = 2), karate (n = 2), basketball (n = 2), rugby (n = 2), soccer (n = 1), racquetball (n = 1), and bobsleigh (n = 1). They immigrated to Canada from 20 countries, divided by continents as follows: North America (n = 2), South America (n = 1), Europe (n = 10), Asia (n = 7), Australia (n = 1), and Africa (n = 3).
Given that the participants were geographically dispersed across Canada, the second author met with each individual and conducted data collection over Skype, whereby face-to-face contact was enabled remotely. This particular approach to data collection has recently been termed computer-mediated interviewing (see Sparkes & Smith, 2014). A synchronous approach was utilized whereby both researcher and participant used the Internet at the same time (i.e., they meet on the Internet). Sparkes and Smith proposed that Skype interviewing, one form of synchronous interviewing, has various advantages over in-person interviewing. Among these, it is proposed that when the participants and researchers are not sitting physically in the same room, participants might feel comfortable to disclose information that they would have retained had the interview been in person. As well, the use of Skype permitted the researchers to interview audio athletes from across Canada and those training abroad through a medium where physical distance could be overcome.
To begin eliciting stories the participants created drawings that reflected their experiences as immigrant athletes in Canada. The participants were given the choice to create their images in the form of a circle (known as a mandala; see Blodgett et al., 2013), as a flowing river, in the form of a tree, or as a freehand image. Arts-based methods had been used extensively in the coauthors earlier projects. During these projects, in keeping with Coholic and LeBretons (2007) resilience research, the participants found these activities both enjoyable and conducive with self-disclosure. Within the current project, all of the participants were willing to engage in this activity and chose forms that resonated with them most. Once the participants had created their drawings, the images were used to facilitate conversational interviews. Many of the participants then shared that by connecting their drawings with their stories, they learned more about their own reflections as acculturating newcomer athletes. This unstructured and open-ended type of interviewing was selected for two key reasons. First, aligning with the aim of the present study and its narrative approach, the conversational approach invited rich storytelling. Participants were asked to reflect on their experiences holistically and open-endedly and were encouraged to bring forward narratives that could reveal multiple, intersecting layers of experience. This approach helped to capture the multifaceted nature of participants lives, rather than gloss over it (McGannon & Smith, 2015; Smith & Sparkes, 2009). Second, the conversational interview facilitated a participatory process (Blodgett & Schinke, 2015; Blodgett, Schinke, McGannon, & Coholic, 2014).",4,31,28.193548387096776,0,0.480811973909537,0.3213698326457312,0.4734947110481915,0.4592474814715894,0.0,0.3982660695910454,0.3992000429617744,0.42821410454125103,0.42278368335088223,0.2362631874899548,0.21039905950263552,0.23488939706291845,0.23055534102844105,0.17018614609321012,1.4195383158237418,0.2853311517849913,0.16757330501591994,1.4041076844626597,0.2811317870173258,0.1671283439994643,1.3982964984756023,0.28146375156838055,0.16396025724577296,1.387654276092466,0.277401840337262,0.05325854700854701,0.028138528138528136,0.024096385542168676,0.01663798049340218,3.118887518572576,3.535257085856649,0,0,1.2521920692250363,6.47427300714648,8.781828095855388,-0.8189859542883079,0.9978328790286897,0.3327458052783495,,-0.5380855770399773,-0.605319028733196,1.0812364522138973,1.1403881323138838,-0.6381081815864973,-0.16771744738353175,0.397796122089524,0.8032102611282723,0.9875213125750989,-0.0875216902999892,-0.10350442190302543,0.6522713103343456,0.4664262330799317,0.8931039357418319,0.912535459467491,0.8870289855310417,0.8261840122443757,0.8498648449763895,0.7930047998362679,0.5983667679545077,0.8580540266368729,0.7477256720229785,0.461321490054706,0.7379265088381488,0.5380248087146986,0.6529788239480133,-0.18529284586787959,-0.3695456142480867,-1.0474736923928314,0.20589960411967395,0.2226472300143423,,,2.1204334495981225,0.3229347763328727,-0.09512182915560506,0,0.21863095472795213
64,methods_21.txt,"We conducted a cross-sectional, web-based survey of 1095 adults in the United States in August 2014. Research Now12 provided the sample from a combination of online research panel members (n = 805) and a convenience river sample of Internet users (individuals who were invited to participate when they visited general, social media, and loyalty websites) (n = 290). The survey included brief embedded animated videos, developed by the study team along with Booster Shot Media,13 to explain basic concepts about ROMP. The animated videos posed an example of doctors wanting to compare three effective and commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications to discover which is best. The first video conveyed that different doctors might treat the same patient with different medications. The second video described two research methodsrandomization and medical record reviewthat could be used to compare the medications. After viewing the videos, respondents answered survey questions about their attitudes about ROMP. The videos were iteratively refined by the study team, with input from patient focus groups. We designed the survey questions based on a series of focus groups in which we qualitatively assessed patients views about ROMP,14 and we refined the survey using a series of cognitive interviews with members of the public to ensure that the questions were clearly written. The videos and survey instrument are available on the ROMP Ethics Study website.15 Further details about survey development and administration are described elsewhere.16 The University of Washington and Stanford University institutional review boards approved this study.
After respondents had viewed the videos, the survey presented three hypothetical examples of ROMP: a medical record review study of antihypertensive medications, a randomized study of antihypertensive medications, and a randomized study of medications for a more serious condition described as causing an increased risk of stroke. Each scenario was followed by a question asking respondents whether they would be willing to consider participating in the study described. For the first and second scenarios, we also asked respondents to imagine that they were the medical decision-maker for a family member and to state whether they would be willing to consider giving permission for their family member to participate in the study. For the questions about randomized studies of hypertension when the patient is oneself, hypertension when the patient is a family member, and a more serious condition when the patient is oneself, we offered respondents the opportunity to write an open-ended response about why they would or would not consider participating. Table 1 shows the wording of each scenario and the subsequent questions (all tables for this article are available through the IRB: Ethics & Human Research web page). We limited open-ended responses to these three scenarios to minimize the burden on survey respondents. We also asked a series of standard demographic questions at the end of the survey
One author (DMK) preliminarily reviewed and cleaned all the open-ended responses, removing nonresponsive or nonsensical responses. A total of 113 such responses were deleted from the hypertension-self scenario, 135 from the hypertension family member scenario, and 154 from the more-serious-conditionself scenario. A subgroup of the authors (KMP, DMK, MC, and CJ) used a conventional content analysis approach17 to inductively develop a codebook based on initial review of respondents open-ended answers, which the entire study team iteratively reviewed and revised. Two coders (SAK and KMP) subsequently underwent a training process wherein they applied the codebook to a subset of respondent answers, stratified by question and by response of willing or unwilling, and made additional revisions to finalize the codebook (see the Appendix, available through the IRB: Ethics & Human Research web page). The two coders then each independently coded half of the respondent answers, stratified proportionally based on question and response. Inter-rater reliability was calculated on 20% of all respondent answers, resulting in a Cohens kappa of 0.84. Coding, inter-rater reliability testing, and calculation of kappa were done using Dedoose qualitative software.18 Basic descriptive statistics were calculated using Microsoft Excel.",3,24,31.166666666666668,0,0.5358735115631766,0.3785250575916059,0.5150082895049343,0.4485006409032004,0.041666666666666664,0.4167359206871486,0.400227225493258,0.43616279297900395,0.408191069976666,0.24532625166538322,0.21557237408624486,0.22853946076735618,0.23391440160022384,0.15430547719299179,1.3068102945069433,0.26364716180229925,0.1603923327900353,1.3475502246016409,0.2716665897270908,0.15372643616165796,1.3259023902056544,0.26486672087581614,0.15732208045631785,1.3371441512595315,0.2678343984354694,0.031114890400604688,0.03674855976646258,0.0,0.02318578741342969,3.073253348838581,3.4788293951159863,0,0,1.179439898118059,6.554253550682122,9.160086543369756,-1.0556870971462002,0.1000398002111027,0.9748109627263011,,-0.13163308066946344,-0.13647449817729682,1.3827533904924327,1.0568684965791988,-0.40713167120645943,0.24837462452623035,0.4314900591426151,0.8645743048824586,0.7148370012407278,0.1730904052726392,0.11135100638515923,0.5708126315457658,0.5672900297920873,0.5696009679571364,0.6306668315240611,0.6206986665917525,0.4656578729246295,0.4837105106519167,0.4924602496332227,-0.6076612826267801,-0.4585129886284762,-0.5176994151305813,-0.264450984922817,-0.2262050007896051,-0.2763742635982025,-0.04304636881466143,0.07291885871986449,-1.0247945567145438,-0.5692499695589637,-0.20418753858786845,-0.37704508671350245,,,0.608723252671335,0.5802052316054528,1.3455403234850267,0,0.3065318177786358
65,methods_22.txt,"The participants were 610 adolescents aged 13 to 20 years (Mage = 16.8; SDage = 1.63; 385 females, 63.1 %). Data were collected by a paper and pencil questionnaire. Participants were recruited from Italian public schools and universities. Written informed consent was obtained by parents on behalf of minor participants. Adult participants were asked to provide a written consent to participate to the study. The majority of participants lived with both parents (78.9 %), or with only one parent (14 %). The parents educational levels were as follows: 34.7 % of fathers and 28.4 % of mothers had a middle school degree, 44.7 % of fathers and 51.4 % of mothers had a high school degree, and 20.4 % of fathers and 20.3 % of mothers had a university degree or post-university education. This study and its procedure for data collection were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology of Sapienza University of Rome.
The participants were initially asked about some personal data, as well as family composition and further information about socio demographics
Sexting behaviors were assessed through the Sexting Behaviors Questionnaire (SBQ; Morelli et al. 2016b), an instrument inspired by the Sexting Behaviors Scale (Dir 2012). The scale was composed of 29 items that evaluated the frequency of different sexting behaviors on a five-point Likert scale, from 1 (never) to 5 (frequently or daily). Sexting was defined as the exchange of provocative or sexually suggestive messages, pictures, or videos via smartphone, Internet, or social networks (a sample item is BHow often have you received provocative or sexually suggestive pictures, messages or videos over the Internet (i.e., Facebook, e-mail, Myspace)?^). The strength of this scale is the deeper assessment of the three subdimensions of sexting: receiving, sending, and publicly posting. For a more detailed description of the scale, see Morelli et al. (2016b). The scale reached a Cronbach alpha of 0.92. The three subdimensions showed good reliability as well: the receiving subscale exhibited a Cronbach alpha of 0.85, with the sending subscale showing 0.84 and the posting subscale showing 0.94.
Alcohol consumption was assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (Babor et al. 2001). This scale was developed by the World Health Organization to evaluate alcohol-related problems and the possible risk for individual health. The scale assesses the amount and frequency of drinking, the alcohol addiction, and the problems related to alcohol abuse. In our scale, the participants had to rate eight items on a five-point scale, ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (frequently or daily). A total score for alcohol consumption based on these items was used in this study.

66,methods_23.txt,"All experimental protocols and consent materials were approved as an Exempt Study by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board. Instructors volunteered to include the study intervention as part of their Introductory Psychology curriculum, and all students of participating sections completed all the study procedures because they were part of the normal instructional activities of the class. A statement about this study was included in the syllabus of participating sections. Participants consent to have their data analyzed and included in this study was obtained from all students in compliance with the IRB of Indiana University. Parental consent for this study was waived by the IRB of Indiana University for students under the age of 18 enrolled in the class, because this activity was part of their curricular activities (and was specified as such on the syllabus), and a parent or guardian of any minor would have already consented to their participation in the course.
A total of 2061 (Time 1: N = 678; Time 2: N = 1383) undergraduate students registered in one of the 18 sections of Introduction to Psychology at Indiana University participated in the study as part of their normal class activities and agreed to have their study data and grades included in the analyses for this study. The instructors of the participating section agreed to include the tutorial as an extra-credit homework activity and the posttest questions as part of their first evaluation point. Instructors were unware of the manipulation introduced (except for one section whose instructor was the fourth author). Some instructors taught more than one section in the same or across data collection times.
Students access the tutorial through a website, which randomly assigned them to either the Self-Regulated (N = 1386) or Yoked (N = 657) groups (see details below). Neither the student or the instructor had any a priori knowledge of the condition. The final sample of 2061 students includes 1208 students who were matched to another student (i.e., 604 complete Self Regulated-Yoked dyads). The remaining students (N = 853) either did not have anybody paired with them or the student paired to them was not included in analyses due to not having consented or missing the exam.
Due to the nature of the research conducted and its inclusion as part of normal classroom activities, it was not possible to collect demographic information about the participating participants. However, to characterize the population we present demographic data for the population of students of Introductory Psychology at Indiana University Bloomington for the past 15 years in Table 1.",4,15,31.333333333333332,0,0.5042532607913017,0.38743465138333183,0.41952642301718396,0.4345168670018514,0.4666666666666667,0.40414293836802245,0.3862125715279168,0.41420088025874324,0.37821934445470035,0.2504949911031872,0.26151365373147334,0.30968320618664463,0.27340089079442914,0.18132605719295733,1.424925542012009,0.2949146181489848,0.17540196434576846,1.4264280360625594,0.28849917953473053,0.1691471784475206,1.406745053889025,0.2810802607324052,0.1765949884393667,1.421437016807339,0.2888313330652468,0.08095238095238096,0.044642857142857144,0.025,0.04878048780487805,3.0565756949747565,3.4701307384711173,0,0,1.1931904761904761,6.416633346185978,8.378256032497262,-0.8189859542883079,-1.0542655868400805,1.0108037654042146,,-0.365047010061257,-0.06338906595861017,0.6892598128548174,0.9481928634938609,1.9488287346699276,-0.0353223082440454,-0.028222654085707437,0.6950278717010014,0.15477149934093873,0.3217196095109847,2.0193604952255173,1.6117462702708507,1.7529659453791784,1.1200335647309703,0.9260058463009512,1.0047364579705518,1.2192277722614397,0.9943673297420172,1.0269386104497098,0.7800402284275976,1.0117003612595357,0.7184867717928257,1.842715872864289,1.3827676156959159,1.5109252318606001,1.5234586390197886,0.3096659544527068,-0.34497377890559455,1.3000771281258994,-0.3540596949116916,-0.4694911444434967,,,0.8944451599274796,0.1375274114722268,-1.6321952279487828,0,4.454215753982018
67,methods_24.txt,"Participants were 213 undergraduate students (128 females) at the University of Oregon with an average age of 19.40 years (SD = 2.32). Due to time limitations and computer errors, 201 participants had complete data on the working memory capacity and attention control tasks, mind-wandering probes, and personality questionnaire. All participants gave informed consent and were given course credit for participation. We collected data with the goal of reaching 200 participants to achieve adequate power for confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling.
After giving informed consent, participants completed three measures of working memory capacity, three measures of attention control, and a personality questionnaire. All tasks were completed in a single laboratory session.
Operation span. Participants solved a series of maths operations while trying to remember a set of unrelated letters. Participants were required to solve a maths operation, and after solving the operation, they were presented with a letter for 1 s. Immediately after the letter was presented the next operation was presented. At recall participants were asked to recall letters from the current set in the correct order by clicking on the appropriate letters. For all of the span measures, items were scored correct if the item was recalled correctly from the current list. Participants were given practice on the operations and letter recall tasks only, as well as two practice lists of the complex, combined task. List length varied randomly from three to seven items, and there were two lists of each list length for a maximum possible score of 50. The score was total number of correctly recalled items
Participants recalled sequences of red squares within a matrix while performing a symmetry-judgment task. In the symmetry-judgment task, participants were shown an 8 8 matrix with some squares filled in black. Participants decided whether the design was symmetrical about its vertical axis. The pattern was symmetrical half of the time. Immediately after determining whether the pattern was symmetrical, participants were presented with a 4 4 matrix with one of the cells filled in red for 650 ms. At recall, participants recalled the sequence of red-square locations by clicking on the cells of an empty matrix. Participants were given practice on the symmetry-judgment and square recall task as well as two practice lists of the combined task. List length varied randomly from two to five items, and there were two lists of each list length for a maximum possible score of 28.

Data were collected in the form of one-to-one semistructured interviews. This type of informal interview permits the interviewer to use a conversational style and ask spontaneous questions while maintaining focus on a specific topic (Patton, 2002).
Participants were Chartered sport and exercise psychologists, Registered with the British Psychological Society (BPS) and the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC). A purposeful sample (Patton, 2002) of 18 UK-based sport and exercise psychologists was contacted via e-mail (available to the public through the BPS website) to participate voluntarily in this study. To qualify for inclusion, participants were also qualified to supervise sport and exercise psychologists in training, and currently working in an applied setting with athletes. Of the 18 participants contacted, 11 (8 males, 3 females) aged between 37 and 65 years (44.5 8.3 years) agreed to take part in the study. Participants had between 10 and 35 years (19.6 7.78 years) of experience, and all had worked with professional, international or Olympic athletes. Participants had worked with athletes from team and individual sports, such as rugby, football, equestrian, judo and shooting. Participants had also worked with youth and adult athletes, and able-bodied and disabled athletes.
Two pilot interviews were conducted; one with a BPS chartered sport and exercise psychologist, and one with a BPS sport and exercise psychologist in training. The purpose of this was to test the interview guide, check clarity, and practice interviewer skills. Each member of the research team contributed to the final interview guide (Appendix). Questions in the interview guide focused on key themes concerning professional practice and applied techniques, therapeutic alliance, and awareness and use of MI. Questions included, When you first start working with a client, how do you begin to build a relationship/ alliance with them? and Which specific communication skills do you employ to underpin your work? Interviews were then conducted with participants, using the finalised interview guide.
Participants were sent information sheets before their interviews, which stated the aim of the study and gave a brief description of the interview procedure. A consent form highlighted participant anonymity and detailed their right to withdraw. Voluntary, written, informed consent was given by all participants. Ethics approval was provided by the governing institution (HWB-S&E-38, Sheffield Hallam University). Participants were afforded an opportunity to ask questions before commencement of their interview, and demographic information was collected at this point. All interviews were conducted by the principal researcher, who has previously conducted interview-based research, is a sport and exercise psychologist in training with the BPS, and a member of the Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers (MINT). Ten interviews took place using video conferencing software, and one was face-to-face. Video software was used to accommodate participants since they were spread across the UK.

69,methods_4.txt,"Grounded theory methodology aims to explain a general pattern of behaviour (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). In the present study a constructivist, grounded theory was chosen according to Charmaz (2014), who stresses that the researcher is a part of what they study, not separate from it (Charmaz, 2014, p. 320).
The women were recruited retrospectively from participants in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating web-based support carried out in Sweden for women with T1DM during pregnancy and up to 6 months after childbirth (MODIAB-Web). Women from both the intervention and control groups at three of the six included hospitals were asked to participate. The health care in the respective hospitals differed somewhat. In pregnancy all women with T1DM had frequent follow-ups at a hospital-based special antenatal care unit, which ended with a final followup around 6 weeks after birth. Parental leave in Sweden is financed by the Swedish Social Insurance Agency and the employer, and parents can use 480 days of paid parental leave for each child. Most of these days can be divided between the parents. The majority of mothers take full-time leave during the first months after birth (the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, 2010).
Based on a purposeful sampling procedure, eligible women were contacted by phone after data collection for the MODIAB-Web study was completed, that is, at least 6 months after childbirth, and asked about their willingness to participate in the present study. Of 18 women contacted, 4 declined and 14 agreed to participate. Interviews were conducted between 2014 and 2016. The participants had a median diabetes duration of 24 years (range 530). Their median age was 33 years (range 2540); eight of them were primiparous and six were multiparous. One woman was single, and the others were living with the father of the child. Most women had a university degree (n = 8), five had completed secondary school, and one primary school.
The interviews were conducted 717 months after childbirth by three different researchers at a place chosen by the women. Five interviews were conducted by telephone due to distance. Each interview started with open-ended questions such as Could you please tell me how you would describe your situation as a new mother with type 1 diabetes and how you handle your situation as a new mother with type 1 diabetes? In accordance with the methodology, follow-up questions were posed, based on emergent data from previously analysed interviews (Corbin & Strauss, 2008).

70,methods_5.txt,"Twelve school systems had comprised the LSES-II population. One additional large system was added to the sampling pool for LSES-III. Nine pairs of schools were chosen using the following procedure:
Within individual school systems, third grade school means on the Total Reading section of the state Basic Skills Test (BST)1 were computed. The BST is administered in late March of each year. Mean scores were developed for both the '82-'83 and '83- '84 school years.
Within each large school system, and among contiguous rural systems, regression models were developed in which mother's education, father's profession, and student body racial composition were independent variables predicting mean BST reading scores. A total of seven separate models were used.
A school was considered for inclusion in LSES-II if a) the school scored above (or below) achievement prediction both years, b) the school scored substantially above (below) prediction at least one year, and c) a matching opposite directional outlier of similar racial composition was identified within that system (or in a contiguous system in the rural models).",4,9,23.333333333333332,0,0.3393789455294609,0.34132298702994984,0.1891688983887434,0.22574187939365703,0.0,0.5019690102587143,0.46406294223852457,0.5463314524127377,0.5143232930917293,0.3583396981159846,0.2724038961653908,0.24728449102905062,0.28649593523393074,0.13057981752839556,1.1460488024617201,0.22359404967705232,0.15922457672647228,1.3626041704310283,0.27021938182570976,0.16812015143600556,1.3874262380992037,0.27779117892269817,0.16302378325597688,1.3891595154454426,0.2756627054221324,0.0,0.025,0.13333333333333333,0.025,3.163224440113553,3.529040805099035,0,0,1.0905817630082335,6.443378108819285,8.500781015340868,-0.8189859542883079,-1.8238025115408696,-0.7168507631356624,,-1.5821139479135569,-0.4416432264030088,-0.9838480741890261,-0.6743129143287698,-0.6381081815864973,2.16852073997518,2.525447613743338,1.7150786982516395,2.6980727266284865,3.4228380113006023,2.471648417115053,0.8112788863075184,2.146175853940465,0.0862887496638001,0.22869382907437516,0.12875239031406083,0.4070297969454411,0.5811701124031462,0.4465076472273983,0.6876188060762434,0.660366305896576,0.46771380445907373,0.358933881697237,0.766658346158618,0.3899862968484117,-1.0210577231409697,-0.27941615871572867,2.600916258266518,-0.43674766645836,0.6043291488483735,0.15658293143978086,,,-1.237651183741029,0.223556299932604,-1.1655378229505216,0,4.009811844641309
71,methods_6.txt,"Seven athletes (4 male, 3 female) were recruited to take part in the study. They represent a range of different sports (Rifle Shooting, 3; Athletics, 1; Football, 1; Fencing, 1; Swimming, 1) and have all competed at professional, national or international level (including Womans Premier South, World Championships, World Cups, European Championships, British Championships, Commonwealth games, and Paralympics games). In accordance with Swann and colleagues (2015), participants therefore represented competitive-elite and successfulelite athlete populations. Participants were aged 2068 years (M = 33.29, SD= 16.40) and were selected from a range of sports to provide and explore different contexts of counterfactuals. To provide free recollections of counterfactuals, participants were also required to be involved in regular training and have recently competed.
A qualitative interview methodology was u to explore the nature of counterfactuals and their perceived consequences in elite athletes. Semistructured interviews were conducted to gather participant data underpinned by a phenomenological perspective, which aims to understand the athletes personal lived experience of a phenomenon (Smith & Osborn, 2003). In relation to the phenomenological approach, an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA; Smith,1996) was used to analyze the data obtained as it offers psychologists the opportunity to learn from the insights of the expertsresearch participants themselves (Reid, Flowers, & Larkin, 2005, p. 20).
The semistructured interview schedule was constructed to suit the use of IPA and follow the guidelines set by Smith (1995) and Smith and Osborn (2003). The interviews were designed to allow the interviewer to frame questions in a broad and open manner and to prompt for more detail if needed. Using suggestions by Smith and Osborn (2003), the first section of the interview was designed to build rapport with participants, through the discussion of their history in their particular sport, their season so far and then a discussion of a recent competitive event to explore the use of counterfactuals and their perceived consequences.
Participants were asked to recall their personal experience of counterfactuals and their perceived consequences around a recent event. A general open question Tell me about your personal experience of a recent positive/ negative event that you thought could have turned out differently. . . was used to get a detailed outline of the event and the counterfactuals experienced. From this, the interviewer used probing questions to get more details on the counterfactuals type (e.g., upward or downward), content, direction (e.g., self or others), structure (e.g., additive or subtractive), controllability and their perceived consequences (e.g., thoughts, behaviors and emotions). These probing questions were designed to be a gentle nudge from the interviewer (Smith & Osborn, 2003) to reduce researcher bias and avoid leading the participant to a predetermined conclusion. As most of the initial counterfactuals were of an upward nature, the process was repeated to explore downward counterfactuals during the specified events. A draft of the interview schedule was piloted in an interview carried out with a novice squash player. This informed the final draft of the interview schedule.",4,19,30.894736842105264,0,0.5378350081543127,0.3679289808381098,0.47575097584298676,0.4240841925210719,0.0,0.33973645805522346,0.37940231038280436,0.40224781484367256,0.3850436037691095,0.23550630643060713,0.215123304657045,0.2649318417350727,0.23455692280658721,0.1622792101539844,1.354765703660102,0.27265102045306455,0.1685290393252742,1.394641011292416,0.28089849282197177,0.16317406616320326,1.3809199631862414,0.275897559491608,0.1656857890995692,1.3834649679070197,0.2780979032698033,0.055907407407407406,0.03055860805860806,0.03076923076923077,0.027972027972027972,3.0696391549780726,3.502356007693059,0,0,1.1563877898623662,6.092929506149845,8.625284359916773,-0.8189859542883079,-0.541240970372888,0.9160858636202306,,-0.11715373228830143,-0.2233941566325245,1.0976239109240922,0.8671147860041651,-0.6381081815864973,-1.4862828870990592,-0.2516148003745548,0.6027499525359622,0.2822927598442018,-0.10928611292325788,0.09270048688117193,1.0376638145525323,0.5865832598357149,0.7320328084174769,0.7505760184553174,0.731287195181586,0.8741673757678942,0.7885773787175484,0.7855971043749185,0.24252414852762397,0.5420424927112085,0.3233365614443644,0.6499792441192888,0.6579614713631946,0.5972750254760709,0.7362384952101186,-0.11271553275151405,-0.1880920609496832,-0.21968349542998844,-0.23666614928871982,-0.1270130790960771,,,0.12972576599084915,-0.9037187543839211,-0.6913454880896645,0,2.0983169537995328
72,methods_7.txt,"The pilot program was conducted in a migratory slum in Worli, Mumbai. A migratory slum is defined as an area where families live in tents on the street, with polythene sheets as roofs, open drains as toilets, and no access to electricity or sanitation (World Bank: Sanitation). The residents of the Worli community in Mumbai are all Hindu migrants from the Surendranagar and Rajkot villages of the Indian state of Gujarat. The average income of each family in the Worli slum is between 6000 and 10,000 rupees a month, with about six people per household. This equates to about $90$150 a month, or about 5083 cents a day per individual, placing most of residents under the extreme poverty line of less than $1.25 a day (World Bank: Poverty). While the male to female ratio is roughly even, women are the primary earners in the household. All children were allowed to participate in the initiative; however, an Adverse Childhood Experiences survey was conducted by all participants before formally enrolling in the curriculum. The ACE survey can be found online (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2016). This initiative was approved by the The Hero Lab, a non-profit organization. Written informed consent was obtained from each childs parents in accordance with the Helsinki II Declaration (Carlson et al. 2004).
The Hero Labs Stage 1 curriculum is a 6-month interactive program rooted in positive psychology interventions focused on themes that promote well-being (e.g., grit, empathy, hope). Table 1 lists examples of interventions from the curriculum. The lessons lead to a student-led project, in which participants exercise their strengths and skills in a designthinking process to ideate, prototype, and launch a project in their neighborhood. Classes were held 5 days a week in Worli for 6 months on a large tarp in front of participants homes. The curriculum was taught by a trained community leader of the same background in regards to faith (Hindu), language, and geography (same community).
Once enrolled into the curriculum, but prior to its intervention, students were administered the eight following surveys by a Hindi-speaking team member to assess their baseline levels of well-being on specific psychological metrics: the General Happiness Scale, the Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ) for Search (Search for Meaning in Life) and MLQ Presence (Presence of Meaning in Life), the Gratitude Survey, the 12-Item Grit Scale, the Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ), the Life Orientation Test (LOT-R) for measuring optimism and pessimism, and the Curiosity and Exploration Inventory (CEI-II). The surveys were administered orally due to low literacy levels and literal language translation issues. Copies of the surveys are available online and available upon request.
The primary objective was to see whether through a positive psychology curriculum, the students would be able to implement a project that shows their determination toward improving their community and its future. Secondary objectives were to see if the variables highlighted by the aforementioned surveys were impacted by the positive psychology intervention.",4,21,28.0,0,0.3645530235022306,0.20078843001974747,0.4147837433964014,0.36086729770159404,0.09523809523809523,0.44718296634845245,0.3826503581277883,0.48946675565093756,0.3948697701681596,0.23919281688256142,0.18856326577205879,0.2131012128148642,0.2256996337906031,0.14950294963667077,1.2952500373388505,0.25597554131478745,0.1497958885839041,1.2885491166151732,0.2557527720063965,0.1508801423193743,1.2981221909314795,0.25538877172372,0.15018251527167217,1.3011748038883666,0.2572170719984789,0.020833333333333332,0.04591242091242091,0.05263157894736842,0.020242914979757085,3.1431878166663343,3.54523342272394,0,0,1.1663605271340078,6.855974866221304,8.848488473947317,-0.8189859542883079,-0.2847286621392917,0.29094771184593277,,-1.3962842876483053,-1.5944487392975093,0.654813294591295,0.3758213687433778,-0.11016187214641064,0.9342910537829837,-0.14507140335352456,1.276082030123823,0.4659090421967672,-0.0032790058745218622,-1.0103773247919714,0.37276666344694076,0.32062205442200037,0.47176932578265157,0.6017612072739355,0.5264731512299095,-0.06634461921465086,0.10173594050186624,-0.012844715727998316,-0.863797219057213,-0.963726671287507,-1.240336786476862,-1.0450418095834215,-0.9127838064447069,-1.1801415286085335,-0.3662189534672452,0.3477397083235211,0.4064070807779807,-0.784184745163215,0.4242719306087723,0.3286719935634886,,,0.33694829138661114,1.5507410242212543,0.15876565023534203,0,1.159087357690799
73,methods_8.txt,"Articles were located through a PsycInfo search (search terms: Oxford House; National Institute on Drug Abuse grants DA13231, DA19935, and DA16037; National Institute of Health, Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities grant #5R24MD002748) and were cross-referenced with records maintained by XX University. Articles were included in the current study if they focused in whole or in part on Oxford Houses or their residents. We included articles from peer-reviewed journals and one book chapter that had empirical data. Magazine articles and non-peer reviewed journal articles were excluded. The aforementioned inclusion criteria resulted in a total sample size of 126 peer-reviewed articles (including the one book chapter). These articles were published between 1995 and July 2015. For the purpose of coding study design and types of data analysis, we only included articles that reported data analyses; thus, 12 theoretical or review articles were excluded from further analysis, resulting in a subsample of 114 empirical articles with data. We had hoped to find articles from different research teams, but instead, we found that all of the articles included authors who were currently or previously associated with the DePaul University team conducting the present review.
The study design coding scheme was created using study designs presented in previous research and advanced psychology research methods textbooks (e.g., Bodner, 2006; Goodwin, 2005; Montero & Leon, 2007). The research team integrated the study designs presented in these resources to create the following categories: (a) descriptive studies using systematic observation, (b) cross-sectional descriptive studies through survey research, (c) longitudinal studies through survey research, (d) experiments, between-subjects designs, (e) experiments, within-subjects designs, (f) quasi-experiments, (g) ex post facto, retrospective studies, (h) ex post facto, prospective studies, (i) measure development studies, (j) ethnographic studies, (k) case studies, (l) action research studies, (m) qualitative interviews, and (n) mixed methods studies.
In some cases, a guideline set by one resource was modified to parallel guidelines from other resources and capture the extent of the research articles surveyed. For example, Montero and Leon (2007) advise that cross-sectional and longitudinal descriptive studies are solely descriptive and should not have hypotheses; however, many Oxford House articles were descriptive in nature but still proposed hypotheses based on existing theory and research. With consultation from the third author, the first and second authors developed this coding scheme. The first author coded all of the articles, and the first and second authors coded a subsample of articles, with high levels of agreement. If a question about coding arose, a discussion between all authors took place to make a final coding decision.
For coding data analyses, every analysis employed in a research article was counted to obtain the total number of times the analysis was used across all Oxford House research studies. Additionally, the main or most important analysis was coded in every study to create a count of the number of times the analysis technique was used as the main analysis among all Oxford House research articles.",4,17,35.76470588235294,0,0.5528038785560057,0.4057330038836774,0.5773728346352333,0.5506126611427005,0.11764705882352941,0.3608657030499209,0.36019597470870185,0.4032040541842341,0.358005199216543,0.2706918758103403,0.22829778317341023,0.3010468205031103,0.26348954021115023,0.16383267193534115,1.3025352713274136,0.268390588856881,0.17438811271441623,1.4026617947135356,0.28545691207092644,0.16895731857356763,1.367669179085708,0.27666633552371034,0.16191101071608074,1.3521998726311888,0.2714730093054124,0.10448717948717949,0.08716178500385661,0.10344827586206896,0.040911747516072475,3.0387940141449197,3.4141051241595957,0,0,1.1433599386724387,6.73013034407693,8.559743969735521,-0.8189859542883079,-0.7977532786064844,1.967788871899343,,-0.006656731988626449,0.08671239013915116,1.8357128173559845,1.8504374232106544,0.014060788898315656,-1.0102795191245604,-0.8816265513425809,0.6101321405778275,-0.22295935202384914,0.9024892416890716,0.6398561215057093,1.5009564080511357,1.4553540300798449,0.7636781691870163,0.6199774314621723,0.6789590901263686,1.1683265846510926,0.8405041205043557,0.9303387321302521,0.7629548748765765,0.30106231227839403,0.3819511712167326,0.23727100558186032,0.061176893882055876,0.03335129809389402,2.263210567838018,1.5847930753115929,1.7882569376673147,0.7253780997511231,-0.5138530849646077,-1.0649103438041712,,,-0.1409786705667761,1.1459416058325107,-0.9409673014923694,0,3.9431291899153917
74,methods_9.txt,"Participants were 20 Greek male adolescent athletes (Mage = 16.35; SD = 1.00), with 210 years of competitive experience in their sport (M = 2.46; SD = 2.8). Participants were football athletes (N = 16), tennis players (N = 2), a sailor, and a fencer. Participants represented all athletes in a sport talent program and were all pupils at the same school in Athens Greece. Convenience sampling was used to recruit participants, whereby information about the study was distributed to all sport talent program athletes, and participants volunteered to take part. The school was informed about the aims and procedures of the study, giving permission for the implementation of the study. Ethical approval was granted by the University, and informed consent and minor assent was gained from participants and their guardians before data collection.
The study employed a single-case AB and ABC betweengroups design (Barker, McCarthy, Jones, & Moran, 2011). More specifically, participants were randomly divided in two groups by flipping a coin, where both groups (REBT+REPDMS group, N = 9; and REBT only group, N = 11) received REBT education workshops, but only the REBT+REPDMS group received REPDMS. To be clear, the REBT+REPDMS group received four 40-min REBT education workshops, followed one week after by an REPDMS session (ABC single-case design). The REBT only group received only the four 40-min REBT education workshops (AB single-case design). Thus, it was possible to assess the effects of REPDMS over and above the effects of REBT education. Data were collected over a 12-week period through baseline (4 weeks), REBT education (4 weeks), REPDMS vs. no REPDMS (one week), and postintervention (three weeks) phases. Baseline data revealed a sufficient level of irrational beliefs to warrant REBT intervention (REBT+REPDMS group, M = 2.89, SD = .06; REBT only group, M = 2.91, SD = .10) based on reported average norms (M = 2.64) for the Shortened General Attitudes and Beliefs Scale (SGABS; Lindner, Kirkby, Wertheim, & Birch, 1999; MacInnes, 2003), and guidelines for using REBT with athletes (M = 2.51; Turner & Barker, 2014). In other words, participants in both groups reported above the norm for irrational beliefs, and therefore were eligible to take part in the study.
The Shortened General Attitudes and Beliefs Scale (SGABS; Lindner et al., 1999) comprises 26 items forming eight subscales. Total irrational beliefs (22 items) is made up of self-depreciation (4 items; e.g., If important people dislike me, it is because I am an unlikable, bad person), other-depreciation (3 items; e.g., If people treat me without respect, it goes to show how bad they really are), need for achievement (4 items; e.g., It s unbearable to fail at important things, and I cant stand not succeeding at them), need for approval (3 items; e.g., When people who I want to like me disapprove of me or reject me, I can t bear their disliking me), need for comfort (4 items; e.g., It s unbearable being uncomfortable, tense, or nervous, and I cant stand it when I am), and demand for fairness (4 items; e.g., It is awful and terrible to be treated unfairly by people in my life). A rational beliefs (4 items; e.g., I have worth as a person even if I do not perform well at tasks that are important to me) subscale is also included. For reasons of brevity, only total irrational beliefs and rational beliefs were included in the current study. Participants were asked to indicate the extent that they agreed with each of the 26 statements on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), with higher scores indicative of stronger beliefs. The SGABS has shown high test-retest reliability in a general population (r = .91; Lindner et al., 1999) and youth athletes (r = .77 to .95; Turner et al., 2014) samples, and acceptable construct, concurrent, convergent, and discriminate validity (MacInnes, 2003). The SGABS was selected for the study due to its prior use in athletic contexts (Turner & Barker, 2013). Across all time points, Cronbachs a for the rational beliefs subscale was medium and ranged from a = .28 to a = .89 (M = .55, SD = .23), however this value is explained by the small number of rational beliefs statements (N = 4; Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). Although the SGABS offers only 4 statements for the assessment of rational beliefs, it was preferred to alternative measures (e.g., Rational Beliefs Inventory; RBI; Shorkey & Whiteman, 1977) due to its simplicity in translating into Greek in clear terms. To translate the SGABS, a researcher of Greek origin who is trained in REBT (Certified) and speaks fluent English translated each item from English to Greek. Then, the translation was validated by a third-party who is of Greek origin but whose main language is English. This third person translated the Greek SGABS items back into English. Any discrepancies between the researchers and the third partys translations were discussed and reconciled to form an accurate Greek translation. Concerning irrational beliefs, Cronbachs a ranged from a = .77 to a = .85 (M = .81, SD = .03).
All participants completed the SGABS at four time points before the intervention to establish the baseline, due to lack of variability anticipated in irrational beliefs (Barker et al., 2011), which should remain stable over short periods of time (e.g., Lindner et al., 1999). All participants received four 40-min REBT education workshops, with each workshop working to specific goals, in compliance with past research and guidelines for group-REBT (Dryden & Neenan, 2002; Dryden & Branch, 2008; Turner et al., 2015). Broadly, participants were educated on the basic notions of REBT and the ABCDE framework and the causal relationship between beliefs and emotions. Participants were also educated on the disputation of irrational beliefs and the promotion of rational beliefs.",4,38,32.078947368421055,0,0.4467731624136905,0.26231758459769244,0.417013377330399,0.3537195905425269,0.10526315789473684,0.43621977468634526,0.4034002044642097,0.49494634935011467,0.4314462796210414,0.26086598130442745,0.19018106687843556,0.2883400618922686,0.22289212088438493,0.17680920428441174,1.3998335178514332,0.2908392206705447,0.16569933637394704,1.3823896197844718,0.2795848121506709,0.17504367453114186,1.4134551277868235,0.2912239164186634,0.16498591247570984,1.3838388964671102,0.2815401893803064,0.10856481481481481,0.03498711078634352,0.1,0.020061728395061727,3.0538296851051734,3.489579530276739,0,0,1.1519080536321915,6.303689979059437,8.55208857340721,-0.8189859542883079,1.8956259578462766,1.171824198436989,,-0.7893528045010255,-1.0897248471088892,0.6710073309103127,0.3202725872699239,-0.05458857641587521,0.6873103331645897,0.535571028630691,1.318384609995292,1.1493945862458546,0.6199416497825535,-0.9431876451430742,1.3379507147738732,0.23631979044429258,1.0280213623393353,0.8632649737135693,0.9546810064091147,0.7320999998788318,0.7092615800030523,0.7438843376612351,1.3106616715126693,1.1337304846349459,1.4918803154096132,0.5734595602379859,0.6650989771271473,0.8902890457131866,2.391379865492106,0.020093646995293913,1.694488554521253,-0.7974178358940278,-0.3787364524341396,-0.26279668535116285,,,0.036641768143697455,-0.22577333888731943,-0.9701241909845583,0,4.122628533706416
75,reports_0.txt,"Stephen Hawking, one of the world's foremost theoretical physicists, has died at age 76. On the cover of the Oxford Dictionary of Scientists, Hawking appeared with Einstein and Madame Curie, an apt demonstration of his renown.
For decades, Hawking used a wheelchair by a form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrigs Disease, a neurological disease that handcuffs movement. He communicated via a speech synthesizer. A cause of death was not immediately available. His family announced his death via statement early Wednesday.
Hawking was best known as the author of A Brief History of Time, the best-selling 1988 book that first brought modern astrophysics into popular understanding for many and made him into an icon. His comments on black holes and other physics phenomena were regularly noted in newspapers. The fact that The Simpsons featured him in one of its cartoon episodes showed his reach into popular culture. He was also featured in Big Bang Theory, as a hero to one of the show's main characters, theoretical physicist Sheldon Cooper.
His book The Grand Design, co-authored with Caltechs Leonard Mlodinow, again attracted readers, as well as controversy, with its claim that cosmology showed God was unnecessary to the creation of the universe.
His public image could not have occurred without the media. With his participation, they shaped and molded it, wrote American University science writing professor Declan Fahy, in the Columbia Journalism Review on the occasion of Hawkings 70th birthday in 2012. This has led to tensions within his field. Other physicists have been, at times, ambivalent about his reputation, because of what some of them see as his having a public profile that is out of proportion to his scientific merit.
However, Hawkings popularity rested on genuine achievement, remarkable strides in understanding black holes and the origin of the universe, Fahy noted, starting with a 1974 paper entitled Black hole explosion? published in the journal, Nature. Hawking radiation, for example, the emission of heat from black holes, is now accepted as a fundamental, unexpected, concept in physics, one that solved a puzzle of how these imploded stars could exist and be theoretically reconciled with conventional understanding of energy. He showed that black holes served as cosmic laboratories for sorting out Einsteins theory of gravity with the quantum theories of electromagnetic and nuclear forces that has divided physics for decades.
He also excelled at encouraging other researchers, famously betting his theories against others as a spur to research. Hawking conceded one such bet in 2004, admitting his theory, created in collaboration with physicist Kip Thorne, that black holes may remove information entirely from the universe, by pulling everything including light down its gravitational maw and preventing it from ever re-entering space, was probably wrong. He delivered a baseball encyclopedia to American physicist John Preskill as the price for losing his wager (Thorne did not concede).
Born in Oxford, England, Hawking graduated from Oxford University and later Cambridge University, taking the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics position there in 1979, a position once held by Isaac Newton. He is survived by his three children, Robert, Lucy and Timothy, children of his first marriage. Hawkings second marriage, to Jane Hawking, ended in 2006, a subject of tabloid news stories.
He was known for a direct and dry wit, often combining the marvelous and mundane in his observations. We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star, he told Der Spiegel in 1989. But we can understand the universe. That makes us something very special.",9,29,23.344827586206897,0,0.45612773299217224,0.26190658596004796,0.31445948393256573,0.2896793324638296,0.27586206896551724,0.46584015964146924,0.38925098153003884,0.47377339035554816,0.4845219937470486,0.2065429952379097,0.17723385208045772,0.24879329580446763,0.2040946152608626,0.17749211606917883,1.3930328861776233,0.28815298705946146,0.17023288154176944,1.4170310135203954,0.28466047258524285,0.17358840280852164,1.4381434264586714,0.29062641085460733,0.17209426827621904,1.4330649119185046,0.2884873113367503,0.027083333333333334,0.026516076516076514,0.031746031746031744,0.020833333333333332,3.1828874597731125,3.6235864286672017,0,0,1.1399004034667723,6.297507384246329,8.856956905713295,0.3645197600011544,0.7413205707950934,-0.7143685008820129,,-0.7202993649110266,-1.0930962705178255,-0.07385102857990825,-0.17741964079016045,0.8911156112744434,1.3546036038365217,0.07144414535364502,1.1549289163518932,2.141191886968046,-0.9421379032830282,-1.4809046804403645,0.8306342369495814,-0.3281201014211533,1.0419328663506218,0.8462604641279854,0.9216877494044639,0.9597100623290246,0.9335307832985725,0.9050497138827754,1.179702815509596,1.5827145314191402,1.4463240623378433,1.350638166049096,1.6047195531421579,1.481641440078128,-0.16976732256512778,-0.23394957759058146,-0.16153007695714805,-0.7410631219197048,0.7810290120472428,1.1613783304691947,,,-0.21286401182130574,-0.24566066287912702,0.1910191245929797,0,2.2341282912993643
76,reports_10.txt,"An attorney for Stephanie Clifford the adult film star who goes by the name Stormy Daniels and has alleged President Donald Trumps lawyer paid her to stay silent about an affair with Trump said Friday that at least one element of his clients allegations against the president has occurred since his inauguration.
CNNs Jake Tapper asked attorney Michael Avenatti: Is there anything in the litany of accusations you would call them facts that surround this case that happened while Donald Trump was president? 
Yes, Avenatti responded, but he declined to elaborate.
When Tapper asked Avenatti why people should care about an alleged sexual relationship between Trump and Daniels from many years ago, the attorney answered: Its all about the cover-up.
Avenatti repeated an earlier charge that Daniels had been physically threatened to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump. He also encouraged viewers to watch 60 Minutes on March 25, when an interview with Daniels is scheduled to air.
I think that when the American people hear from my client, who will provide details very specific details related to this threat they will conclude, as I have, that this was not a random threat by some wing nut ... out of the blue, he said.
Daniels has filed a lawsuit to nullify her agreement to keep quiet about her alleged relationship with Trump, and the president and his personal attorney are attempting to get it transferred to federal court.

77,reports_12.txt,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday gave the green light to two class-action lawsuits filed by residents of Flint, Michigan who are pursuing civil rights claims against local and state officials over lead contamination in the citys water supply.
The justices left in place a July 2017 ruling by the Cincinnati, Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that revived the litigation after the lawsuits were thrown out by a lower court.
The high court rejected separate appeals filed by the city of Flint, Genesee Countys drainage commissioner and Michigan Department of Environmental Quality officials.
The 6th Circuit decided that the civil rights claims brought by the plaintiffs under federal law could proceed, ruling they were not precluded by a statute that sets the standards for drinking water, the Safe Drinking Water Act. That law has its own provisions for people to file suit over unsafe water, although they cannot seek monetary damages like those available under civil rights law.
Flint, a predominantly black city, switched its public water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in a cost-cutting move in April 2014. The polluted river water caused lead to leach from pipes. Lead poisoning stunts childrens cognitive development. No level of exposure is considered safe.
The city switched back to Lake Huron water in October 2015, but lead levels remained above federal standards until early 2017.
The crisis prompted several lawsuits against the city, state, Republican Governor Rick Snyder and several individual city and state officials. Two of those suits were the subject of the Supreme Court appeals.
In one, Melissa Mays and several other Flint-based parents sued in November 2015 on behalf of themselves and their children. In the other, Flint residents Beatrice Boler, Edwin Anderson and others sued in January 2016 on behalf of Flint residents and businesses.
Julie Hurwitz and Bill Goodman, lawyers representing Mays, praised Mondays action by the justices, saying in a statement that it signals that the State of Michigan and all of its cronies are reaching the end of the line in their ongoing efforts to avoid being held accountable.",9,15,26.0,0,0.6616710317986352,0.47262518097912626,0.21753692626953125,0.20230766234022599,0.13333333333333333,0.37063106410205365,0.39965311429455935,0.19986018791061008,0.3830992853012744,0.22597592217581614,0.19981497585300415,0.09814811565659264,0.23249077801075246,0.11019211084669328,0.7015909895166975,0.15546441245021217,0.16518020012821835,1.2323179581629036,0.2572427582003136,0.17808008077830983,1.381929725685943,0.2854309532524589,0.1531146627147768,1.2975548020594796,0.26009505068552796,0.045454545454545456,0.037037037037037035,0.02857142857142857,0.020634920634920634,3.2264719443174488,3.574831876724246,0,0,1.2878669513011365,6.943660350943232,8.694565140128311,0.3645197600011544,-1.0542655868400805,-0.14096592028903648,,0.7969773126427644,0.6354291767125096,-0.7778084787220155,-0.8564331625612699,0.10101665162962405,-0.7902837383255427,0.41265789835568273,-0.9596868308004932,0.24596032720721428,-0.38333618739887637,-0.5430771153526771,-1.1018823694436968,0.524542339700015,-0.3290264778807952,-0.8826422207395536,-0.7080395481772204,0.7060363722019464,-0.26230591077610355,0.03446620835823864,1.5839056865710683,0.5604061417999139,1.050201255145184,-0.7244610274985643,-0.9818819890305542,-0.9351624425656979,0.40768141069261116,0.08157018672755491,-0.2478565249328876,-0.7555543340845307,1.172696852995232,0.6432332527258328,,,2.8617183100774137,1.8327956787405026,-0.4274777579383449,0,-6.170636114662402
78,reports_14.txt,"Forty-five U.S. trade associations representing some of the largest companies in the country are urging President Donald Trump not to impose tariffs on China, warning it would be particularly harmful to the U.S. economy and consumers.
The organizations said in a letter sent to Trump on Sunday that potential tariffs on China would raise prices on consumer goods, kill jobs and drive down financial markets.
The letter marks the latest in a growing rift between Trump and the business community on trade policies, as the president has begun to take more aggressive steps he says are needed to protect domestic industry.
We urge the administration not to impose tariffs and to work with the business community to find an effective, but measured, solution to Chinas protectionist trade policies and practices that protects American jobs and competitiveness, the groups wrote.
Tariffs would be particularly harmful, they said.
The groups called on Trump to work with trade allies to push for changes to Chinas policies. The business groups said while they had serious concerns about Chinas approach to trade, unilateral tariffs by the United States would only separate the country from allies, and encourage them to replace the U.S. business presence in China when Beijing retaliates.
Trade associations publicly pushing back include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation and the Information Technology Industry Council.
The Trump administration is said to be preparing tariffs against Chinese information technology, telecoms and consumer products in an attempt to force changes in Beijings intellectual property and investment practices.
The Republican president recently announced plans to impose tariffs on certain steel and aluminum imports, despite opposition from some business sectors.
The groups also called on Trump to allow industry experts to comment on the economic impact of any changes in trade policy before the measures take effect.
We urge the administration to take measured, commercially meaningful actions consistent with international obligations that benefit U.S. exporters, importers, and investors, rather than penalize the American consumer and jeopardize recent gains in American competitiveness, they said.",11,12,30.833333333333332,0,0.9523951411247253,0.8646422588463986,0.06662060997702858,0.06662060997702858,0.0,0.47371346430179284,0.426302559257573,0.0495144930752841,0.36347617307573044,0.21059522488491333,0.21459002359208804,0.01988396868109703,0.16360388933902695,0.01272529237557505,0.11234959398462667,0.022055956691620457,0.12725693666555155,1.116023713853833,0.22896776283429843,0.14265882740822453,1.2474305564468293,0.2518374831408123,0.1453829717414869,1.250207536999687,0.25217963703593127,0.0,0.004329004329004329,0.0,0.03546099290780142,3.0723002930521175,3.4332807576042694,0,0,1.1766222071579215,6.531721638150209,8.483900135272082,0.8379220457169393,-1.439034049190475,0.9028253573704723,,2.9430405180329724,3.8511467776252606,-1.8739275635223187,-1.910932214182187,-0.6381081815864973,1.5319748036282734,1.2868206625789949,-2.1203587917632234,-0.12072620838716333,-0.8256143920725131,0.07055253323220478,-2.1058757502268324,-1.5439506173740327,-2.314509912744514,-2.355999614455703,-2.346608676817478,-1.1979297394225217,-1.0151976020824875,-0.8633381906096831,-1.6036274369265346,-1.885610171302693,-1.511101464073483,-1.5697908027404501,-1.8856411915633182,-1.6089376898443477,-1.0210577231409697,-0.8993317709205286,-1.0247945567145438,0.32727837065735627,-0.21275208411570187,-0.8611189092404021,,,0.5501747297693207,0.507727662199289,-1.2298315490475236,0,-6.251850853152262
79,reports_16.txt,"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who has said shes rolling back campus sexual assault guidelines to protect the rights of the accused, wouldnt say whether she thought false accusations outnumber actual sex crimes in a 60 Minutes interview broadcast Sunday.
Are you ... suggesting that the number of false accusations are as high as the number of actual rapes or assaults? host Lesley Stahl asked during the 13-minute interview.
DeVos first attempted to dodge the question, telling Stahl that one sexual assault is one too many, and one falsely accused individual is one too many. When Stahl repeated the question, DeVos became flustered.
I dont know. I dont know, DeVos answered. But Im committed to a process thats fair for everyone involved.
The Education Department did not immediately return HuffPosts request for comment.
DeVos has been widely criticized for rescinding an Obama-era Title IX guideline called The Dear Colleague Letter. The 2011 letter was a comprehensive set of guidelines that clarifies schools responsibilities under the gender-equality law. It also serves as a tool for victims and those accused throughout the reporting process.
The education secretary came under fire last summer when she met people wrongly accused of sex crimes in group discussions of campus sexual assault. One group she met with mainly consisted of members of the National Coalition for Men, which a survivor advocate described as viciously and very intentionally harass[ing] rape survivors.
During a September 2017 speech at George Mason University Law School, DeVos called the current campus reporting process a failed system that is increasingly elaborate and confusing. She dedicated nearly half of her 20-minute speech to anecdotes about people wrongfully accused of assault.",8,16,19.6875,0,0.569361898303032,0.35599722745343265,0.3300540531054139,0.3077221242710948,0.0,0.3551078504168017,0.3230148035344145,0.3352013415036102,0.33064058722996537,0.20758743116328882,0.1959379632035802,0.2235939157816271,0.2113288786903482,0.12746622763933005,1.0534195589401263,0.22448487422356814,0.135556303315056,1.14224237120947,0.2432037324831343,0.15827769299106093,1.3389519466534465,0.277210285549668,0.1617881261504261,1.3360291999528258,0.27238099467441973,0.06111111111111111,0.025297619047619048,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,3.152962363415865,3.571396553780556,0,0,1.0896016335336725,6.25116501621356,8.919618660726622,0.12781861714326193,-0.9260094327232825,-1.5041933217150332,,0.11557102894798157,-0.32127037564216554,0.03941376153375392,-0.03719913693230466,-0.6381081815864973,-1.139993441527059,-2.101254030109391,0.08514975272657696,-0.7343071266230629,-0.9121047235619408,-0.7040952014961109,0.5073698595751999,-0.11089410614041023,0.02286222928824671,-0.0029191937914733726,0.1396938077276401,-0.7812537625736773,-0.8454573935489812,-0.41130925094588483,-0.19809695282475717,-0.22119235586452,0.42342413235989684,0.2238356545539412,-0.24748706433728182,0.11064076060473547,0.8998026679019556,-0.2704906721525706,-0.28985317529946353,-0.2887023097474356,0.5121099688845139,0.6067239299488639,,,-1.2580171975445722,-0.394728443556149,0.42967716239479353,0,1.4196140615618447
80,reports_18.txt,"The government agency tasked with guiding relief and recovery efforts after catastrophic natural disasters has decided not to take climate change into account as it plans ahead for the future.
On Thursday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency released its 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, a document it describes as setting FEMAs overall vision with the aim of readying the nation for catastrophic disasters.
While it concedes disasters will become more devastating and more costly in the next five years, FEMA has stripped all mention of climate change from the 38-page document, despite it being a significant cause of exactly the type of damaging storms theyre preparing for.
Instead of acknowledging the risks posed by climate change, FEMA said rising natural hazard risk, decaying critical infrastructure, and economic pressures that limit investments in risk resilience are primarily to blame.
Weather and climate-related disasters cost the U.S. $306 billion in 2017, making it the costliest, most damaging year on record. That figure and the damage behind it will increase as the temperature rises.
Natural disasters have caused a record-setting amount of damage in the U.S., said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) in response to the 2017 figures when they were released in January. Theres no denying that climate change will cost the U.S. trillions more in the next decade and that we have a financial and national security reason to act.
FEMA Public Affairs director William Booher defended the puzzling exclusion in an email to NPR, emphasizing the agency focuses less on causes and more on mitigating their effects.
It is evident that this strategic plan fully incorporates future risks from all hazards regardless of cause, Booher wrote. Building upon the foundation established by FEMAs previous two Strategic Plans, this plan commits the agency, and the nation, to taking proactive steps to increasing pre-disaster investments in preparedness and mitigation.
In contrast, FEMAs 2014-2018 Strategic Plan named climate change as a prime contributor to increasing disaster risk and it urged we take action.

81,reports_2.txt,"WASHINGTON As students across the country protested congressional inaction on gun violence, the House on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed legislation to help schools identify potential threats hours after an FBI official told senators at a hearing about missed tips that pointed to the danger of the alleged Parkland, Fla. mass shooter.
A parent at that Senate Judiciary Committee hearing blamed those lapses and others for the Valentines Day massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
""The testament to their failure is 17 dead children and teachers, 17 more with life altering injuries, a burden we must bear forever,"" said Ryan Petty, whose daughter, Alaina Petty, was among the slain students.
But a language arts teacher who survived the attack pointed the finger at Congress, saying its inability to enact gun control legislation is allowing mass shootings to happen. Increased funding for mental health programs and school security will have positive effects, but ""mass shootings will not stop until we rid society of the weapons that make them possible, Katharine Posada told senators.
The Senate hearing focused on the governments response to the shooting and legislative proposals to improve school safety as students from nearly 3,000 schools staged National School Walkout events to urge lawmakers to do more to address gun violence.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Congress must rally around ""consensus, evidenced-based solutions"" to protect young people from violent attacks.
But gun-control advocates say they expect more from Congress than additional school security. They are calling for an expansion of background checks, a ban on ""assault weapons"" and high-capacity magazines, and other measures.
""High school students who have lost their friends are literally begging us to take action,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, of California, the committee's ranking Democrat and one of the most vocal proponents of gun control.
Hundreds of students rallied outside the White House, calling out President Trump and the National Rifle Association with signs and chanting, No more silence. End gun violence!
Gun-control measures are unlikely to advance in the GOP-controlled Congress. The less controversial school safety bill that passed the House 407-10 does nothing to curb access to guns, but it marks Congresss first legislative action in response to the Florida shooting.
The bill, which is backed by the NRA, would fund training for students, school personnel and law enforcement to detect early signs of violence. It would also fund threat assessments and anonymous reporting systems such as phone apps, hotlines and websites for threats of school violence.
""As we saw in Florida, students and families saw obvious red flags and warned authorities repeatedly about their concerns for the shooters mental health,"" said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. ""At the same time, schools are currently open targets for would-be attackers.""
Though the bill passed with bipartisan support, House Democrats on Wednesday complained that lawmakers are not doing enough to stop gun violence.",13,18,31.11111111111111,0,0.7678032534963944,0.6063399133728999,0.1960071623325348,0.1960071623325348,0.0,0.3647891610418841,0.38727029900991955,0.14534780303350625,0.3551300583694464,0.22080068852184181,0.20506026744684677,0.08350251198579103,0.20490434481593328,0.05664808709017321,0.47119615124546027,0.09873234475015963,0.1353859030199538,1.1566196339220163,0.23642570274601532,0.14566518184924518,1.2605868854887663,0.2536840594200792,0.14599064063339787,1.2576264466940108,0.25278302979988315,0.041025641025641026,0.034731934731934734,0.01694915254237288,0.0288135593220339,3.200838002512206,3.5724037863078095,0,0,1.2051857622753146,6.8057919096618456,8.72903712301349,1.311324331432724,-0.6694971244896861,0.9628133618336627,,1.580422677459081,1.7322916419890362,-0.9341811342594574,-0.9053978291756208,-0.6381081815864973,-0.921891163613058,0.006473227226107469,-1.3805236011607223,-0.2766855614268286,-0.5321521354638679,-0.32523237506526226,-1.289760084991556,-0.30380604232958774,-1.4197645759548843,-1.4587285938539967,-1.4048425672111053,-0.7898088382096335,-0.7523786543188844,-0.6265292655045789,-1.333087762296597,-1.6463477606932082,-1.3703109821848214,-1.5033524764292772,-1.744029888343642,-1.5575757362263531,0.2684709309857494,0.012441010300546434,-0.5638991141322053,-0.15822165637509555,0.9423398636488824,0.6174284191778903,,,1.1436940278800294,1.389319364524448,-0.2961853006369988,0,-7.4256584124427665
82,reports_20.txt,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe late Friday, less than two days shy of his retirement, ending the career of an official who had risen to serve as second-in-command at the bureau.
McCabe had more recently been regularly taunted by President Donald Trump and besieged by accusations that he had misled internal investigators at the Justice Department.
In a blistering statement Friday night, McCabe said his firing is part of a larger effort to discredit the FBI and the special counsel's investigation.
""This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally,"" McCabe said. ""It is part of this Administration's ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel's work.""
Shortly after midnight, Trump tweeted.
""Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy,"" Trump said. ""Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!""
McCabe had been expected to retire this Sunday, on his 50th birthday, when he would have become eligible to receive early retirement benefits.
But Friday's termination could place a portion of his anticipated pension, earned after more than two decades of service, in significant jeopardy.
The origin of his dramatic fall stems from an internal review conducted by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. That report -- the details of which have not been publicly released -- is said to conclude that McCabe misled investigators about his role in directing other officials at the FBI to speak to The Wall Street Journal about his involvement in a public corruption investigation into the Clinton Foundation, according to a source briefed on it.
CNN reported on Wednesday that the findings in Horowitz's report on McCabe were referred to the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, staffed with career officials, who recommended McCabe's termination. McCabe, accompanied by his lawyer, tried making a last-ditch effort Thursday to avoid the firing, meeting with officials at the deputy attorney general's office at the Justice Department for several hours while Sessions was traveling, but to no avail.",10,16,29.0625,0,0.7310703754425049,0.5042566167811553,0.1992436543107033,0.18817040125528972,0.0,0.39848399851867494,0.3966624340172923,0.19316368888151678,0.3443959718206454,0.23680576047998794,0.1830112546325681,0.09945269161835313,0.1804660014293733,0.0752106383835905,0.6485192649776615,0.12935688364261624,0.13109352638218655,1.1430727290581788,0.22981308574427983,0.15065404274537872,1.301323284733489,0.2645232475297693,0.14986241149202384,1.2966578311068273,0.2600018247825714,0.01909722222222222,0.011746031746031746,0.0,0.01773049645390071,3.2072385762579274,3.5969788756052594,0,0,1.1576580537518038,6.373161784533403,8.769775488279999,0.6012209028590468,-0.9260094327232825,0.5204018289176352,,1.3092684267769776,0.8949019665310332,-0.9106741953662648,-0.9663016293526233,-0.6381081815864973,-0.16280790596088385,0.314556743089135,-1.0113839456942446,-0.477267658910141,-0.07191978335145356,-1.2409605827704167,-1.0851469205701991,-1.0376255274648603,-1.0416293430621708,-1.0153444007624768,-1.0287013119759354,-1.0053108522882157,-0.8400816371749822,-0.836496996922279,-0.884143757159342,-0.9055112361752887,-0.5438872192569525,-1.0800397494957903,-0.9990032684083675,-0.9430980108882128,-0.42078885094005564,-0.6768978269950366,-1.0247945567145438,-0.9676810142845357,0.9998580131927854,0.8786032438276136,,,0.15612045422121057,-0.002305952535657173,-0.14102625161753624,0,-5.147216951460738
83,reports_22.txt,"Facebook (FB) is under intense pressure to answer these questions and more after it admitted that a company linked to President Donald Trump's campaign had accessed and improperly stored a huge trove of its user data.
The controversy erupted as UK media and The New York Times reported that data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica tried to influence how Americans voted using information gleaned from millions of Facebook profiles.
Here's what you need to know.
Facebook said it gave permission to University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan to harvest information from users who downloaded his app ""thisisyourdigitallife.""
The app offered a personality test. But Facebook users who downloaded the app also gave the professor permission to collect data on their location, their friends and content they had ""liked.""
That was allowed under Facebook's rules at the time.
The New York Times, however, reported that Kogan provided that data which included information from over 50 million profiles to Cambridge Analytica, breaching Facebook's rules.
Cambridge Analytica was working to develop techniques that could be used to influence voters.
Facebook said it asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data in 2015, but learned several days ago from ""reports"" that not all of it had been purged.
Cambridge Analytica said that the data set revealed by The New York Times was not used ""as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.""
The company's methods came under further scrutiny late Monday after a British television channel aired a report showing CEO Alexander Nix discussing potential bribery and entrapment of politicians.
In the report, Nix is seen suggesting the encounters could be filmed and posted to the internet.
Cambridge Analytica said in a statement that the undercover Channel 4 report was ""edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.""
Nix said the company does not engage in bribery or entrapment.
Facebook has been unable to shake off questions over its role in the 2016 presidential election.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg initially expressed skepticism that Facebook could have been used to influence voters, but a series of revelations over Russian meddling have caused the company to make big changes in recent months.
It has sought to crack down on fake news, undermine the business model used by trolls and make political advertising more transparent.",17,18,24.166666666666668,0,0.9540713745004991,0.8025135806962556,0.04063603106667014,0.04063603106667014,0.1111111111111111,0.4345868981697343,0.4349011167856915,0.029739457894774043,0.363634650100346,0.23053418224056563,0.20838234510587816,0.018409774364794,0.21311100346117126,0.008586734752679534,0.07549972747489955,0.015103752432661913,0.1357663288238052,1.1596559084291138,0.2350511781185841,0.15179546156507068,1.3037706753328138,0.26384480440931046,0.15203545026549095,1.3015058684598375,0.2619946395858567,0.0,0.01568627450980392,0.015151515151515152,0.023066485753052916,3.138275311943038,3.540702676237192,0,0,1.1266641414141414,5.955075197729959,8.846247134021496,2.2581289028642937,-0.6694971244896861,-0.5368867497460914,,2.955414114360204,3.3415049912628256,-2.062655949914548,-2.1128727334912627,-0.02217082057306287,0.6505246022220806,1.5688730215510234,-2.2730224838377406,-0.11776483353185645,-0.25226156576482656,-0.18726156221362703,-2.1247871086553576,-0.05738156394037678,-2.3988159128108126,-2.4481401593855687,-2.431998071439843,-0.7707092731304402,-0.7327217412661305,-0.6701739855486629,-0.781428298235905,-0.8610027283209413,-0.5956144806411217,-0.8424546747284754,-0.9064644836132496,-0.773465778600195,-1.0210577231409697,-0.5587313852804414,-0.6127819641030594,-0.5779632509465282,0.380126172347873,0.2805209205445384,,,-0.4878989971653826,-1.347149607947274,0.15022912283311035,0,-5.740980364424943
84,reports_24.txt,"At least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in attacks during the first month of a military crackdown in Myanmar in late August, Mdecins Sans Frontires estimates.
The aid group interviewed several thousand Rohingya refugees in four camps in Bangladesh in late October and early November, asking how many members of their families had died and how, both before and after the violence began.
The survey showed that a minimum of 6,700 Rohingya -- including 730 children -- were killed by shooting and other violence between August 25 and September 24, and that at least 2,700 others died from disease and malnutrition, according to MSF.
The aid agency's death toll far surpasses estimates from Myanmar's government, which has put the figure in the hundreds.
More than half a million Rohingya have fled northwestern Myanmar into Bangladesh since a concerted military crackdown began in late August, following militant attacks on a border post. Both the UN and the US have described the campaign as ethnic cleansing.
""We met and spoke with survivors of violence in Myanmar, who are now sheltering in overcrowded and unsanitary camps in Bangladesh,"" Sidney Wong, MSF's medical director, said in a statement. MSF also is known as Doctors Without Borders.
""What we uncovered was staggering, both in terms of the numbers of people who reported a family member died as a result of violence and the horrific ways in which they said they were killed or severely injured.""
He said that the ""peak in deaths coincides with the launch of the latest 'clearance operations' by Myanmar security forces in the last week of August.""
Zaw Htay, a Myanmar government spokesman, did not respond to a request for comment on the MSF report.
The Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority in Myanmar's Rakhine state thought to number about 1 million people. Myanmar does not recognize them as citizens or as one of the 135 recognized ethnic groups living in the country.
In an exclusive CNN report published last month, refugees described surviving mass killings and rape before reaching the relative safety of the camps, where conditions are dire.

85,reports_26.txt,"Officials from at least four countries have discussed ways they could use Jared Kushner's intricate business arrangements, lack of experience and financial woes to manipulate President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior White House adviser, The Washington Post reported Tuesday.
The paper reported that it is unclear, based on current and former US officials familiar with intelligence reports on the matter, that the countries -- - Mexico, Israel, China and the United Arab Emirates -- acted on the conversations.
The revelation is the latest in a series that call into question Kushner's ability to work in the White House given his complex business ties.
CNN reported earlier on Tuesdaythat Kushner has been stripped of his access to the nation's top secrets after chief of staff John Kelly mandated changes to the security clearance system. Kushner had been working on a temporary clearance, but, under the new system, aides who previously had ""top secret"" interim clearances saw their access downgrade to the less sensitive ""secret"" designation.
Peter Mirijanian, a spokesperson for Kushner's attorney Abbe Lowell, declined to comment on the story.
""We will not respond substantively to unnamed sources peddling secondhand hearsay with rank speculation who continue to leak inaccurate information,"" Mirijanian said.
According to the Post, national security adviser H.R. McMaster told his deputies in spring of 2017 that he wanted all the intelligence reports on conversations where foreign leaders discussed interactions with senior Trump officials, including Kushner. The order came after McMaster learned that Kushner had contacts with foreign officials without coordinating with the National Security Council.
Kushner -- while on Capitol Hill Tuesday for a meeting on prison reform -- declined to respond to repeated CNN questions about his security clearance and The Washington Post report. Kushner's meeting had been scheduled long before news about his security clearances broke, and according to a source in the room, the story did not come up during the meeting.
Top White House officials were worried Kushner was ""naive and being tricked"" by foreign officials, one former White House official told the Post.
Before stepping into the White House, Kushner worked at the CEO of his family's real estate and development company, Kushner Companies. The extensive network and debt from the company, according to the Post, was also seen as leverage foreign officials talked about in efforts to manipulate Kushner.
Officials from the White House and National Security Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this story.
The news of foreign interest in Kushner's business ties and financial woes comes after CNN reported special counsel Robert Mueller has expanded his probe beyond Kushner's contacts with Russia into his efforts to secure financing for his company from foreign investors during the presidential transition.",12,16,31.875,0,0.8466768582661947,0.6396100913484891,0.21288421750068665,0.21288421750068665,0.0,0.3475195574848091,0.3769063378765345,0.13026640947942655,0.32391748944027643,0.23974691608957216,0.22579982810194407,0.07409334193259753,0.21664885246076634,0.04787309956316307,0.42579055305675545,0.08399583710019909,0.12306758974280393,1.0989125638798232,0.22106395147104702,0.14425094436251162,1.2559426265782774,0.25411112428769994,0.14416856025675626,1.2527602218084268,0.25741494676931725,0.0,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.023378582202111614,3.2142255432074003,3.601180051364178,0,0,1.1760556573056573,6.612929203323597,8.871522256513188,1.0746231885748316,-0.9260094327232825,1.1277803741074357,,2.162650761209435,2.0052070401743807,-0.8116015304134161,-0.7742369088150494,-0.6381081815864973,-1.310943846698282,-0.3334884089444318,-1.4969522800772497,-0.8599380361662565,0.012654342129976381,0.5361123421451937,-1.4104634315063649,0.04885078128466689,-1.598518665288139,-1.572262154657248,-1.5858414878709093,-1.4082590687694532,-1.125975592177089,-1.1143046901150664,-1.4603539769151441,-1.7308087512078205,-1.337749820653,-1.702566180207677,-1.8369158346889394,-1.1632980471994945,-1.0210577231409697,-1.0291570300210102,-0.491601789805564,-0.5551690654161684,1.0626457297044083,0.9232517628574959,,,0.5384024461975241,0.7689450325766848,0.24649376045433266,0,-7.663165809890189
86,reports_28.txt,"Vladimir Putin has extended his grip on Russia for another six years after an overwhelming victory in Sunday's presidential election, a result that was never in doubt.
With 99.8% of the votes counted, Putin won with 76.7%, according to Central Election Commission data. It means Putin will rule until 2024, when he will be 71 and obliged by law to step down.
Putin sailed to victory against the backdrop of wall-to-wall support from state media and with no serious challenger. His nearest rival, Communist Party candidate Pavel Grudinin, won 11.79%,while ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky took 5.7%. Former reality TV presenter Ksenia Sobchak was on 1.7%, while veteran liberal politician Grigory Yavlinsky received just over 1% of the vote.
His fiercest opponent, Alexei Navalny, was barred from the race.
Putin, a former KGB spy, has dominated Russian politics for 18 years and the 65-year-old was already the country's longest-serving leader since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.
He declared victory in front of thousands of people gathered in below-freezing temperatures at Moscow's Manezhnaya Square near the Kremlin, where he called for unity in the country.
""We are a single team, I am a member of this team, and all those who cast their ballots today are members of our large national team,"" he said, after a colorful show of high-energy musical performances.
""I see this as a sign of trust and hope, the hope of our people that we will work as hard, with the same responsibility and effectiveness as before. Thank you for being such a powerful, millions-strong team. We will definitely succeed.""
Although his victory was a foregone conclusion, the high score is a major boost to Putin, who already enjoys sweeping powers over his country. He won with 63.6% of the votes cast in the 2012 election.
Voter turnout was put at 67.5%, close to the 70% ambition of the Kremlin.
Under current Russian law, Putin can not stand for re-election. But he has not groomed a successor, prompting speculation he may try to find ways to extend his power beyond this term.
Putin's critics have slammed the election as unfair, citing the Kremlin's tight control over the media, quelling of the opposition and restrictions on some election monitors to ensure a free vote.
By early evening Sunday, the non-governmental election monitoring group Golos had counted 2,000 incidents of voting irregularities, including observers being prevented from carrying out monitoring.",13,20,24.25,0,0.678636906178374,0.41971866185531803,0.14302740704554778,0.13448843359947205,0.0,0.43351330775767566,0.40318372360169435,0.2520415194746521,0.30852518175274896,0.20474000764079392,0.19042173455037723,0.10014752761357361,0.147705003609642,0.0709615250777424,0.6054846284381207,0.12105871191081016,0.11878308546478879,1.0158451232284527,0.20281894865358893,0.1527474230476381,1.3074545666908444,0.26021188267950324,0.15414625615592295,1.313431340526979,0.2629280175875207,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.023170731707317073,3.1094427043322277,3.5454275296259006,0,0,1.1747906594621924,6.427982638673923,8.827907607068227,1.311324331432724,-0.4129848162560899,-0.5188903484071347,,0.9222157692607221,0.20143679639315024,-1.3189779693847072,-1.3834938595344783,-0.6381081815864973,0.6263385675533889,0.5284699610684768,-0.5568458415828074,-1.147565804680723,-0.993983544765931,-0.9331923597424961,-1.0762333788414475,-2.021352540884858,-1.128187458059229,-1.1229495357923507,-1.1306223479895543,-1.6233658450752826,-1.6637561698494527,-1.6936308253329093,-0.6957619688637136,-0.7940070850882237,-0.8726032011971996,-0.611673714250061,-0.678832431125827,-0.6940148463159868,-1.0210577231409697,-1.0291570300210102,-0.34497377890559455,-0.5703495737340724,0.12102467579721118,0.33073488885836483,,,0.5121171806176921,0.17403426071730732,0.08037988998047282,0,-3.6096979746577644
87,reports_30.txt,"South Korean officials who returned from a two-day visit to the North Korean capital reportedly brought back the communication. The North also said it was willing to send a delegation for dialogue with the South next month at the border village of Panmunjom.
""North Korea has clearly expressed its intention for denuclearization on the Korean peninsula, and if there is no military threat and North Korea's regime security is promised, they have clarified that there is no reason to hold nuclear weapons,"" South Korean President Moon Jae-in's office said.
Taken at face value, the sudden shift would mark a major diplomatic breakthrough following last year's heated rhetoric, with Pyongyang threatening the U.S. with ballistic missiles and President Trump promising to rain ""fire and fury"" on the North. However, the North has yet to corroborate the South Korean statement.
Kim made the offer during a meeting with Moon's special envoy in Pyongyang, and NPR's Elise Hu reports that the surprise change in position includes a promise to temporarily suspend nuclear and missile tests while negotiations were underway.
The United States current has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War. That conflict ended with a truce, but no peace treaty something that has kept the two Koreas on a war footing ever since.
Last month, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement, ""the international community broadly agree that denuclearization must be the result of any dialogue with North Korea.""
However, in a Tuesday morning tweet, the president said: ""Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!""
Hours later, Vice President Mike Pence issued a statement saying, ""Whichever direction talks with North Korea go, we will be firm in our resolve. The United States and our allies remain committed to applying maximum pressure on the Kim regime to end their nuclear program. All options are on the table and our posture toward the regime will not change until we see credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearization.""
And in the afternoon, Trump, speaking in the Oval Office, said he was encouraged by the apparent diplomatic progress. ""We have come certainly a long way, at least rhetorically, with North Korea,"" he told reporters.
""The statements coming out of South Korea and North Korea have been very positive. That would be a great thing for the world,"" he said.
""Hopefully we'll go in the very very peaceful, beautiful path,"" the president said. ""We're prepared to go whichever path is necessarily. I think we're having very good dialogue, and we're going to certainly find out pretty soon what's happening, but we have made progress, there's no question about it.""",11,23,24.91304347826087,0,0.5847473645752127,0.3935862963746777,0.31218691802386084,0.31659757910352765,0.0,0.3923415711448927,0.3759851717484361,0.2950245111766789,0.3812718233230697,0.2357400264923594,0.22467418271758802,0.22520019024531676,0.2538682939616418,0.154668927349009,1.2370696914947363,0.2538083236386709,0.16886156080701575,1.4102330254814879,0.2847500844664856,0.17303149764917305,1.4325289892917386,0.2900699287494989,0.17337099171266246,1.434354143785804,0.2910450443908965,0.07222222222222222,0.026046176046176046,0.03636363636363636,0.052597402597402594,3.1238395576461033,3.542203858136482,0,0,1.096061025142658,5.873347665894083,8.399583972091634,0.8379220457169393,-0.028216353905695445,-0.37570158992760644,,0.2291432508770007,-0.012927098380923879,-0.09035688377962019,0.031776926299231956,-0.6381081815864973,-0.30118559613357376,-0.3637047654188339,-0.2250162316862293,0.21181152889141813,-0.10256539751270612,0.4893626196514761,0.5279755774113674,1.1664531885826759,0.5770047621456648,0.4562852726767324,0.49985462874619224,0.8908618681405338,0.8895204477699169,0.9078951234093927,1.1295873206251175,1.4806097751080232,1.4038956045371516,1.4902263026292015,1.6293282641796163,1.6993606013651612,1.249050011727942,-0.24804172109977898,-0.03596433444698139,1.5788482073765193,0.25040063407324686,0.29647491829278266,,,-1.1237981355884934,-1.6100395358501802,-1.5509641131664764,0,0.6213681693779001
88,reports_32.txt,"A 15-year-old high school student will be charged with two counts of murder and several counts of attempted murder after a mass shooting at Marshall County High School in Benton, Ky., according to police.
Kentucky State Police identified the students who were killed as a girl, Bailey Nicole Holt, who died at the scene, and a boy, Preston Ryan Cope, who died at the hospital. Both were 15 years old.
Authorities say 12 other people were shot and five are in critical condition. In addition, five people suffered other kinds of injuries in the scramble when the shooter opened fire with a handgun on students and faculty.
""We are trying to determine that every one of those that has been shot was a student. It is our belief that they are,"" Gov. Matt Bevin said at a news conference Tuesday.
""The shooter was a student, a 15-year-old male,"" he added. ""That student is in custody. That student was apprehended at the scene.""
Kentucky State Police Commissioner Rick Sanders said that the shooting began just before 8 a.m. and that first responders arrived on the scene within 10 minutes of the first gunshot. The shooter was soon arrested in a ""nonviolent"" fashion and will be charged with murder and attempted murder, according to Bevin.
""I did not see the shooter, but I did see the commons after. It was a disaster. Everyone just dropped their stuff and ran,"" Allissa Hubbard, 16, told member station WKMS.
She had been in the library when a series of loud pops were heard, and students began to run outside. According to WKMS, Hubbard hid beneath a set of stairs with another girl as they listened to the screams of their teachers.
""I'm terrified,"" she added. ""I've been feeling like I'm going to throw up all day long. It was awful.""

89,reports_34.txt,"NPR has placed its senior vice president for news, Michael Oreskes, on leave after fielding accusations that he sexually harassed two women seeking career opportunities nearly two decades ago, when he worked at The New York Times.
The allegations from the two women were first reported by The Washington Post on Tuesday afternoon. They included similar accounts of unwanted and unexpected kisses during business meetings.
Meanwhile, a current NPR employee is going public with her account of filing a formal complaint with the network's human resources division in October 2015. Rebecca Hersher says she considers the incident less severe but nevertheless felt it crossed a line and made her uncomfortable. At the time a 26-year-old assistant producer on Weekend All Things Considered, she said Oreskes hijacked a career counseling session into a three-hour-long dinner that delved into deeply personal territory.
Oreskes did not respond to multiple efforts to reach him for comment. NPR executives say that they cannot address individual personnel matters but that they take concerns of sexual harassment or other inappropriate workplace behavior seriously.
According to The Washington Post, there were two separate complaints about Oreskes from his tenure as Washington bureau chief at The New York Times nearly 20 years ago. Both women tell similar stories: After meeting Oreskes and discussing their job prospects, they said he unexpectedly kissed them on the lips and stuck his tongue in their mouths. The Post did not disclose their names, stating they spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not want to damage future employment prospects. The women also shared their allegations with NPR management in mid-October.
After joining NPR in the spring of 2015, Oreskes encouraged staffers to reach out to him to discuss their careers during his visit to NPR West in Culver City, Calif. At the time Hersher had been working a series of temporary assignments for NPR, and she took him up on his offer during a subsequent visit to Washington. An afternoon meeting was pushed off into evening and an invitation to dinner at a seafood restaurant near Union Station.
Hersher, now a reporter and producer on NPR's science desk, says she wanted to tell him about her belief that she would need to leave NPR to transform from a producer to a reporter. Her dinner with Oreskes became increasingly uncomfortable as the conversation veered into personal matters involving relationships and sex. At one point, she says, he referred to a former flame as his first ""sex girlfriend.""
Hersher says the conversation made her uncomfortable.
""From my point of view, every little thing that he or I said pointed to the relative difference in power,"" she said. ""Like he's the one with the power. He's the one who gets to decide what we talk about and I am trying to keep up.""",9,21,25.142857142857142,0,0.4769332453608513,0.3064426612025792,0.19753752207314526,0.19726206776168612,0.047619047619047616,0.4353095717848309,0.3940704880311849,0.3256768187651267,0.4303822519818117,0.23114901696962695,0.21311169781870434,0.18089978923686803,0.22855206299830247,0.12549580892484913,1.0906368144019112,0.21797414086016162,0.14929793873986497,1.2916868963684387,0.2569594328667528,0.1498695081719456,1.303364031397036,0.258331371145439,0.1538724288182135,1.3169489755202435,0.2655248109269842,0.01452991452991453,0.020811904145237477,0.0,0.05478750640040963,3.231734496115677,3.6642527428384595,0,0,1.153299699618718,6.051856007059776,8.49513546974837,0.3645197600011544,-0.2847286621392917,-0.32607176263259485,,-0.5667175217428996,-0.7277666736233974,-0.9230659907183045,-0.895645265744794,-0.374135026866454,0.6668051212287283,0.22953498480944806,0.011620234663435019,1.129511674487448,-0.23458174312758637,0.009155471047710235,-0.04032179881183301,0.4062730373658737,-0.017276905021411913,0.09013998182691549,0.05972671243803725,-0.09134456757807541,0.12205000092178246,0.025469894565180694,-0.9547434593556249,-0.8683979985383226,-1.015981044858872,-0.6416121071114246,-0.6116882150385988,-0.4729707983504432,-0.5643496581377567,-0.40501562412611636,-1.0247945567145438,1.7388039920932494,1.2199882761298164,1.5935646531423306,,,0.06555864301263799,-1.0358383592704656,-1.1870398513111995,0,-4.403285807193885
90,reports_36.txt,"Democrat Doug Jones has won the Alabama Senate special election, a victory that was a stunning upset in a deeply red state that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump. The president, who had backed Republican Roy Moore despite multiple accusations of sexual misconduct and assault, congratulated Jones on Twitter.
The win by Jones, projected by The Associated Press two hours after the polls closed Tuesday night, is sure to send shock waves through Washington. The special election to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate in February, was upended in November as multiple women came forward to say Moore had pursued them romantically as teenagers when he was in his 30s. Some alleged he had sexually assaulted them, including one woman who said he had initiated sexual contact with her when she was just 14. Moore has denied the accusations.
The unfolding controversy made what should have been a safe GOP race anything but. It's the first Democratic Senate victory in the state in 25 years and now gives Republicans an even narrower, 51-49 Senate majority that could imperil GOP legislative priorities in 2018. Jones will be up for re-election to a full term in 2020.
""Alabama has been at a crossroads. We have been at crossroads in the past, and unfortunately we have usually taken the wrong fork,"" Jones said in his victory speech. ""Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, you took the right fork.""
NBA legend Charles Barkley returned to his native Alabama to campaign for Jones in the closing days and told CNN after the Democrat's victory, ""We got a bunch of rednecks and ignorant people, but we got some amazing people here and they rose up today.""
It's the first major electoral blow to Trump since his own upset victory just over a year ago, giving Democrats a special election win after several near misses. Democrats were victorious in November in the Virginia and New Jersey governors' races, but the win in such a red state that Trump won by almost 30 points is a political earthquake heading into the 2018 midterm elections.
The president had come to Moore's defense, casting doubt on the women's allegations much as he has done with the multiple women who have accused him of sexual assault. While Trump didn't campaign with Moore, he did hold a rally just across the border from Alabama in Pensacola, Fla., on Friday evening and recorded a robocall on his behalf, urging voters to choose Moore because he would support his agenda in the Senate. And after Trump reaffirmed his endorsement for Moore last week, the Republican National Committee reinstated its financial support for the GOP nominee after having pulled it following the accusations.
Trump was unusually restrained on Twitter late Tuesday, congratulating Jones and refraining from placing blame.",8,19,27.526315789473685,0,0.5871851229005389,0.3664313369288997,0.34309541806578636,0.32316949032247066,0.05263157894736842,0.4222976957188131,0.40300643650338375,0.367222215413972,0.4503114432188577,0.22592795102928692,0.20832526133935061,0.20184621578458734,0.24440463058891,0.128936288068829,1.0985054576628785,0.21815216161483555,0.15906222284297875,1.3536213773916395,0.26955564722876735,0.15557641920514792,1.338007406121125,0.2646968921627132,0.1582477760488337,1.3487466098543979,0.2688407366534499,0.07787878787878788,0.07751831501831502,0.038461538461538464,0.04281567489114659,3.236282429391731,3.6519812115517483,0,0,1.2149400772238141,6.205743203796959,9.037077598193248,0.12781861714326193,-0.541240970372888,0.1886523779192297,,0.2471382615341604,-0.23567933539296976,0.13413439463749433,0.08285087939213538,-0.34634837900118626,0.3736712760465838,0.5226545386409018,0.3323515801815477,1.5019177438161195,-0.3847156172232723,-0.18963233571045587,0.22838455547264946,0.8822841484058026,0.05280863234934316,0.10981498058797932,0.06191322536337831,0.3988786974872782,0.5230152975689163,0.42543235320282924,-0.44118263864933926,-0.23836987126119827,-0.5306478465735474,-0.16324181219887718,-0.004738592669223998,-0.1907128172503809,1.426848659493899,1.2955889317369416,0.02108356299153193,0.8644327860657637,1.2608578476213799,1.4631474248182417,,,1.3463779773390707,-0.5408351070413384,0.8770396649628915,0,-5.703269442681431
91,reports_38.txt,"Just days into one of the biggest storms to hit the U.S. in decades, authorities have rescued thousands of people in Houston alone. And as floodwaters from Hurricane Harvey, now a tropical storm, continue to rise across southeast Texas and neighboring Louisiana, officials expect that still thousands more evacuees will need to be sheltered in the days to come.
Several deaths have been reported, but the exact number remains unclear. A spokesperson with the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences told NPR six deaths are suspected of being related to flooding, though final determinations will not be made until autopsies are finished.
""This is a landmark event,"" Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Brock Long said at a news conference Monday. In fact, it has been such a landmark event with more than 3 feet of rain having already hit some regions the National Weather Service has even had to revise its traditional methods of representing storms ""in order to effectively map it.""
So how does one respond to a catastrophe of such historic proportions?
For authorities, that has meant summoning a rescue and evacuation effort nearly as massive. ""The goal is rescue,"" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner told reporters Monday. ""That's the major focus for the day.""
Here's how that rescue effort is taking shape, sketched in a few telling and staggering numbers.
Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo told reporters Monday that officers have rescued roughly 2,000 people in the city out of about 4,000 water-related calls for assistance since the storm came ashore Friday evening.
That includes ...
...nearly 300 rescues over a 12-hour span since midnight on Monday. But that number does not include the 185 critical rescue requests in the city still outstanding as of midday.
Police hope to work through that backlog of requests by nightfall, because they say their boats are not properly equipped to conduct rescue operations in the dark.

92,reports_4.txt,"Gina Haspel, President Trumps nominee to become the first woman to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, made her career in covert action, but her involvement in controversial interrogations has already provoked Senate opposition to her confirmation.
Haspel, who joined the CIA in 1985, earned high-level awards during her career. She was sworn in early last year as deputy director and helps manage intelligence collection, analysis, covert action and counterintelligence.
Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said he would move to quickly confirm Haspel. ""She has the right skill set, experience and judgment to lead one of our nations most critical agencies,"" he said.
Haspel's past in the agency drew opposition to a potential promotion. Shortly after she became deputy director, senators raised questions about Haspel drafting a cable that called for the destruction of taped CIA interrogations in 2002 at a secret prison in Thailand.
Christopher Anders, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Unions Washington legislative office, called Haspel the central figure in one of the most illegal and shameful chapters in modern American history.
She was up to her eyeballs in torture, both in running a secret torture prison in Thailand and carrying out an order to cover up torture crimes by destroying videotapes, Anders said. One man held at the secret prison she ran was waterboarded 83 times, slammed against walls, sleep-deprived and locked in a coffin-like box. After she was promoted to a position back at CIA headquarters, she worked to destroy evidence of the torture crimes committed at the prison she ran.
Trump said in a statement that Haspels appointment would be a historic milestone. Haspel and Pompeo have worked together for more than a year and have developed a great mutual respect,"" he said.
Haspel said that after 30 years at the CIA, she was honored to serve with Pompeo during the past year. If confirmed, I look forward to providing President Trump the outstanding intelligence support he has grown to expect, she said.
Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., called Haspel an excellent choice and a true professional.
John Brennan, a former CIA director, told MSNBC the ""very controversial"" interrogation program Haspel was connected with was approved by President George W. Bush and deemed lawful by the Justice Department.
Gina Haspel has a lot of integrity, Brennan said. She has tried to carry out her duties at CIA to the best of her ability, even when the CIA was asked to do some very difficult things in very challenging times.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who was tortured as a prisoner during the Vietnam War, said the Senate would need the same commitment from Haspel as Pompeo gave to comply with the Army Field Manuals rules for interrogation.

93,reports_40.txt,"President Donald Trump signed the $1.5 trillion rewrite of the tax code into law at the White House on Friday capping off a victory lap before leaving to spend the holidays in Mar-a-Lago.
""Everything in here is really tremendous things for businesses, for people, for the middle class, for workers. And I consider this very much a bill for the middle class and a bill for jobs. Corporations are literally going wild over this,"" Trump said.
Trump indicated that he was going to wait until after the new year to sign the bill, but when he saw reports on the news speculating about the timing he ""immediately called and said lets get it ready.""
""I'll sign this today rather than having a big formal ceremony in two weeks when we were going to do it. I didn't want you folks to say I wasn't keeping my promise. I'm keeping my promise,"" Trumps said. ""I'm signing it before Christmas. I said the bill would be on my desk before Christmas. And you are holding me literally to that. We did a rush job today. It's not fancy. But it's the Oval Office.""
The measure, known as the the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is being hailed by the GOPas the biggest legislative achievement for Trump and congressional Republicans. After the bills passage, Trump celebrated with Republican lawmakers at the White Houses South Lawn.
Trump thanked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, among other Republican lawmakers for their efforts to get the bill passed.
""I don't think I'm going to have to travel too much to sell it. I think it's selling itself. It's becoming very popular,"" Trump said.
Some 55 percent of Americans oppose the tax bill, while 33 percent are in favor according to a CNN poll released Tuesday.
Ryan and McConnell held an enrollment ceremony for the bill on Thursday at the U.S. Capitol.
Trump also on Friday signed a one month-long stopgap spending bill aimed at keeping the government running until January 19. The ""continuing resolution"" passed both GOP-controlled chambers on Thursday and maintains current government spending levels. The bill also includes a $4 billion defense funding provision.",10,25,17.36,0,0.4951672738728424,0.26811278383946047,0.16524794516153635,0.16284623424160397,0.0,0.4109344905483778,0.36023550729536974,0.2763088122074906,0.3211021275548157,0.2831305594493945,0.22440133945959986,0.18925166215113778,0.24240046619812583,0.10952859367072973,0.9182808548554895,0.18682908901634185,0.13681034799287664,1.1681297613398396,0.23488076376592493,0.15518878853875348,1.323680563318813,0.2671012858516099,0.1561271904679665,1.3243010966888902,0.26793697662339117,0.04817708333333333,0.04160894660894661,0.05555555555555555,0.0707070707070707,3.236074743214319,3.6268756105729114,0,0,1.0829372772665455,5.827550184957438,8.390746996007831,0.6012209028590468,0.22829595432790084,-2.006832811112104,,-0.4321178225080199,-1.0421868053890353,-1.1575881574556863,-1.1631097229321135,-0.6381081815864973,0.11767898036967386,-0.8803297920559818,-0.36950182568444084,-0.9125471882904644,1.2601686475270704,0.4780310344360089,0.06681825761392975,0.8221043376015852,-0.34254289692768924,-0.34082418544693743,-0.32280766419495793,-0.7182935014826445,-0.6778618168757001,-0.6755850830036446,-0.47606524361834435,-0.4989193706221263,-0.3473270978394559,-0.395092016591214,-0.4713517635897282,-0.26764261077600326,0.4932569317295182,0.21868008536645253,0.4859182828608987,2.9015006631479046,1.2589914954652803,1.1963345211494019,,,-1.3964951999419808,-1.7573545983648184,-1.5846212517482696,0,-2.472778889549354
94,reports_42.txt,"A self-driving Uber car hit and killed a pedestrian Sunday night in Tempe, Arizona, police said, in what appears to be the first case of a pedestrian death caused by an autonomous vehicle.
The vehicle was in ""autonomous mode at the time of the collision, with a vehicle operator behind the wheel,"" Tempe police said in a statement.
The female pedestrian, identified as 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, was walking her bicycle across the street outside the crosswalk when she was struck, police said, adding that an investigation is ongoing.
She died of her injuries at a hospital.
There were no passengers in the Uber vehicle.
In a briefing on Monday afternoon, police said the car was equipped with multiple cameras -- one looking forward and one facing the human driver.
Police added that the driver showed no signs of impairment and that prosecutors will be looking at the case for possible charged.
The vehicle was going 40 mph when it hit the pedestrian. There was no indication the car attempted to slow itself before the collision.
In a statement to ABC News, Uber said, ""Our hearts go out to the victims family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident.""

95,reports_44.txt,"President Xi Jinping vowed Tuesday to protect ""every inch"" of China's territory, improve the lives of its people and promote the resurgence of Chinese culture and creativity as he kicked off his second term, poised to rule indefinitely.
Xi, China's most powerful leader in decades, sounded a stark warning clearly directed at the government of self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory, and advocates of independence in the southern Chinese city of Hong Kong.
""Every inch of our great motherland absolutely cannot and absolutely will not be separated from China,"" Xi declared in his speech before the nearly 3,000 members of the National People's Congress.
""All acts and tricks to split the motherland are doomed to failure and will be condemned by the people and punished by history!"" he said.
Xi is set to shape China for the coming decades after the historic legislative session that closed Tuesday abolished presidential term limits to allow him to rule for as long as he wants.
As an indication of what is to come, Xi stressed the absolute leadership of the ruling Communist Party of which he is head in all aspects of Chinese life. That authority is central to Xi's vision of a confident, rising China with him at the helm to tackle thorny challenges that include slowing growth, risky excessive borrowing, a possible trade war, tensions with rival Taiwan and other challenges.
Xi said the mainland would continue to promote ""peaceful unification"" with Taiwan. The island's 23 million residents are strongly in favor of maintaining their de facto independent status, but Xi has warned a Taiwanese envoy that the issue of unification cannot be put off indefinitely.
Now that he has made it possible to be president-for-life, Xi seems determined to bring Taiwan under Beijing's control during his time in office, something that would place him in the history books alongside Mao Zedong, said Willy Lam, an expert in Chinese politics at the Chinese University in Hong Kong.
That increases the potential for provocative, dangerous actions, he said, possibly drawing in the U.S., which is legally bound to respond to threats against Taiwan.
""Xi is consumed by hubris,"" Lam said. ""Now that he's made himself emperor-for-life, he might be feeling impregnable on the foreign policy front, and this is very dangerous.""
Xi's hard-line remarks might have been prompted by President Donald Trump's signing of a law on Friday that encourages expanded contacts between officials from Washington and Taiwan, Lam added. China has officially protested the law, saying it violates U.S. commitments not to restore direct official contacts with Taiwan that were severed when Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.
China's longer-than-usual, 16-day legislative session had earlier approved a range of new appointments, including that of key Xi ally Wang Qishan as vice president. New ministers were also appointed and a law passed establishing a powerful new anti-corruption body to oversee the party and civil service.",12,18,32.166666666666664,0,0.6918487846851349,0.47196734728279455,0.20073194801807404,0.20073194801807404,0.0,0.3788411043419996,0.36018095330750244,0.1706729130776323,0.3708884937693636,0.20880187280914364,0.18709108488334902,0.09964914790449526,0.20281949389932885,0.07159534374908225,0.6244896759248848,0.12410235644165167,0.1493571407324996,1.2990918908242066,0.2570802575208061,0.15083132051064474,1.3069981060783882,0.2596173844393084,0.1501807043359472,1.3000896132228503,0.2573685753119646,0.0,0.008333333333333333,0.014705882352941176,0.016624040920716114,3.086825830159749,3.505146773489438,0,0,1.1144499331615896,5.940329616866839,8.817784253951197,1.0746231885748316,-0.6694971244896861,1.190767778793785,,1.0197430311144768,0.6300329643656496,-0.8998645812932878,-0.8686789091479604,-0.6381081815864973,-0.6053264998439418,-0.8821192876683547,-1.1850132131266107,0.017783838572908973,-0.8771829602211294,-1.0715191808011868,-1.082626726860534,-0.3664086583091899,-1.115276023251028,-1.075428727775687,-1.0932392455585043,-0.08837228678193752,0.16999011036606954,0.02930639054010809,-0.8681906585227391,-0.802308326729142,-0.9179301636729787,-1.0452398048078357,-0.933497802263144,-1.1672452749158932,-1.0210577231409697,-0.7792434062525831,-0.6248999815328089,-1.0484917789714465,-0.08221972111921742,-0.09735386774243064,,,-0.7416968272757619,-1.3945811723529742,0.04182336390853,0,-3.0372559783150606
96,reports_46.txt,"A Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee said he does not believe President Donald Trump will move to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, despite a tweet this weekend by a Trump attorney calling for an end to the Russia investigation.
Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on This Week Sunday, I dont see the president firing him. I think the White House has said 10 times, maybe more, that they are not going to fire Robert Mueller. They want him to be able to finish the investigation.""
Stephanopoulos asked Lankford about a statement by Trump attorney John Dowd to The Daily Beast on Saturday suggesting that the Justice Department official who appointed Mueller end the Russia probe.
I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation,"" Dowd said, calling the probe ""manufactured.""
Lankford said on ""This Week,"" ""The clearest thing that I can explain from that is the presidents exceptionally frustrated, that he wants to be able to see this investigation come to an end. He has stated over and over again there was no collusion.""
""So its not that Mueller has found nothing, its that the president seems to be very, very frustrated that they have not connected anything to him and ... he wants to be able to move on,"" the Oklahoma senator said.
Lankford added that Dowds comments were nothing more than talk typical from any attorney.
""What I read yesterday was what a typical attorney puts out at every stage during every investigation saying, 'This is wrapped up. We should be done,'"" Lankford said. ""So its not different than what an attorney does typically.""
The Oklahoma Republican sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible ties to Trump associates. He said the special counsel should be allowed to finish his investigation.
""I would say the best thing the special counsel can do is to finish the investigation, gather all the information thats needed [and] come to a conclusion so the American people can make their own decisions, Lankford said. ""What I have said over and over again as well is its best for the special counsel to be able to go through their process. Its best for the president, best for the presidency for this to be resolved and to be finished one way or the other.""
Lankford added that he has had concerns about some of the people on Mueller's investigative team.
It is odd the number of Democrats that hes put on board his team. That does raise some flags in some sense there, the senator said, adding that Mueller seems to have addressed the issue of any possible bias in the probe.
Clearly, he also identified some individuals that were biased that were from the FBIthat he fired immediately once he found out that they were biased, that tainted that, the Senate Intelligence Committee member said, referring to federal agents dismissed over text messages showing possible bias against Trump.
Mueller ""seems to be moving on from there,"" Lankford said.",14,23,25.956521739130434,0,0.6675670895386826,0.4585738584528983,0.17559281869658402,0.1715736419317268,0.0,0.38886439111992355,0.380385756477152,0.21442560140507855,0.3163227142499738,0.23212552516971055,0.23757642489736733,0.12441801385072265,0.18621844252190564,0.08281492823771305,0.688626996984518,0.1390185933289856,0.1335887209513177,1.1309077484547159,0.22843698992936118,0.15750254207462103,1.3342471012557835,0.26846175687838897,0.1594735169589362,1.3372649736245363,0.2697121064109005,0.04538690476190476,0.034163059163059166,0.025974025974025976,0.07126207126207126,3.088494852844435,3.5024521737038454,0,0,1.1543352575886823,5.617087317101479,8.284108683817786,1.5480254742906165,-0.028216353905695445,-0.15035534707457954,,0.8405007500422385,0.5201661238641035,-1.0824523895667197,-1.0952842158401797,-0.6381081815864973,-0.37952012267980617,-0.21935551852111634,-0.8472415289155636,-1.0018575120955133,-0.206501852768031,1.025211875406633,-0.764885099045908,-0.8648947783292796,-0.8867233783852124,-0.9150577882712954,-0.9100328277936663,-0.8800377226111773,-0.9188380096478046,-0.8801916062420126,-0.26785222647491,-0.30675517873110764,-0.2435992564248435,-0.029227753486332192,-0.22389875724825087,-0.11654014608147259,0.40555531079107304,-0.0046193602863758105,-0.31848725509485626,2.942035522350215,-0.06722120689475444,-0.12599106282991254,,,0.0870764000621424,-2.4343427186961852,-1.9907715476721648,0,-4.040291783329093
97,reports_48.txt,"Vladimir Putin rolled to a crushing re-election victory Sunday for six more years as Russia's president, and he told cheering supporters in a triumphant but brief speech that ""we are bound for success.""
There had been no doubt that Putin would win in his fourth electoral contest; he faced seven minor candidates and his most prominent foe was blocked from the ballot.
His only real challenge was to run up the tally so high that he could claim an indisputable mandate.
With ballots from 80 percent of Russia's precincts counted by early Monday, Putin had amassed 76 percent of the vote. Observers and individual voters reported widespread violations including ballot-box stuffing and forced voting, but the claims are unlikely to dilute the power of Russia's longest-serving leader since Josef Stalin.
As the embodiment of Russia's resurgent power on the world stage, Putin commands immense loyalty among Russians. More than 30,000 crowded into Manezh Square adjacent to the Kremlin in temperatures of minus 10 (15 Fahrenheit) for a victory concert and to await his words.
Putin extolled them for their support ""I am a member of your team"" and he promised them that ""we are bound for success.""
Then he left the stage after speaking for less than two minutes, a seemingly perfunctory appearance that encapsulated the election's predictability.
Since he took the helm in Russia on New Year's Eve 1999 after Boris Yeltsin's surprise resignation, Putin's electoral power has centered on stability, a quality cherished by Russians after the chaotic breakup of the Soviet Union and the ""wild capitalism"" of the Yeltsin years.
But that stability has been bolstered by a suppression of dissent, the withering of independent media and the top-down control of politics called ""managed democracy.""
There were widespread reports of forced voting Sunday, efforts to make Russia appear to be a robust democracy.
Among them were two election observers in Gorny Shchit, a rural district of Yekaterinburg, who told The Associated Press they saw an unusually high influx of people going to the polls between noon and 2 p.m. A doctor at a hospital in the Ural mountains city told the AP that 2 p.m. was the deadline for health officials to report to their superiors that they had voted.
""People were coming in all at once, (they) were entering in groups as if a tram has arrived at a stop,"" said one of the observers, Sergei Krivonogov . The voters were taking pictures of the pocket calendars or leaflets that poll workers distributed, seemingly as proof of voting, he said.
Other examples from observers and social media included ballot boxes being stuffed with extra ballots in multiple regions; an election official assaulting an observer; CCTV cameras obscured by flags or nets from watching ballot boxes; discrepancies in ballot numbers; last-minute voter registration changes likely designed to boost turnout; and a huge pro-Putin sign in one polling station.",13,16,34.625,0,0.8261181871096294,0.5948480047285557,0.08760539843485905,0.08760539843485905,0.0,0.3864698763936758,0.3745469447566347,0.08919148334191562,0.40938208405279825,0.19160998077994143,0.1795477797396431,0.04237483790478645,0.18770893489593987,0.03588752972060014,0.30111956871323237,0.06054992373929253,0.15420725563177537,1.3252715251064169,0.2634426598978397,0.15091149540141177,1.3092433298064632,0.2597835313913784,0.15174639015872038,1.3117179497770843,0.26057662056604103,0.00641025641025641,0.012454212454212453,0.0,0.015488215488215488,3.129141064580304,3.546730991615132,0,0,1.1597072119111906,6.490718555949465,9.295136869211266,1.311324331432724,-0.9260094327232825,1.7216616182930184,,2.0108910470835784,1.6380234710798822,-1.7215131150107112,-1.747847828886411,-0.6381081815864973,-0.43346417390570197,-0.4108819011707644,-1.814051583244142,0.7370928401923378,-1.3715428060595782,-1.3848038324816292,-1.8173568727935512,-0.8201391936641846,-1.8426750946565864,-1.8839933364058365,-1.8738123635361985,0.15513139835836637,0.33947768259821065,0.2313291590025372,-0.8609757777469915,-0.761476447272154,-0.9052624446575717,-0.8740585135176748,-0.711537438601895,-0.8941702872989705,-0.8195688709336699,-0.6556597461473169,-1.0247945567145438,-1.131447595087288,0.29804212384644596,0.34458759361783065,,,0.19869970976130802,0.37583456471535603,1.8599026448559415,0,-9.308810561797857
98,reports_6.txt,"WASHINGTON President Trump tapped CNBC commentator Larry Kudlow on Wednesday to head his National Economic Council, the post vacated when Gary Cohn resigned because of his opposition to the presidents steel tariffs.
Kudlow has also been a staunch opponent of trade barriers. But Trump's appointment of his longtime friend and loyalist may say more about Kudlow's evolving views than Trump's.
""If it comes to that, I would be in favor targeted tariff and tax increases on China until they play ball and come to the table with us,"" Kudlow told CNBC Wednesday. ""I've known the president a long time. We have a mutual admiration society. He is the president. He has a different role, and I will abide by that.""
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed the move after it was first reported by Kudlow's network. She said the timing of the appointment hadn't been determined. 
Trump had signaled Kudlow was the leading contender on Tuesday, saying he and Kudlow had come to an understanding on tariffs.
""He now has come around to believing in tariffs as also a negotiating point. I'm renegotiating trade deals and without tariffs we wouldn't do nearly as well,"" Trump said Tuesday.
One of the first economists to back his 2016 campaign for president, Kudlow served as an informal economic adviser to the campaign.
Kudlow, 70, worked in the Reagan administration as associate director for economics and planning at the Office of Management and Budget. As director of Trump's National Economics Council, he would likely be the president's most visible voice on issues of jobs, taxes and trade.
Before joining the business news cable channel CNBC, Kudlow was chief economist at investment bank Bear Stearns & Co.
In 1994, Kudlow publicly acknowledged to The New York Timesthat he had developed an addiction to drugs and alcohol at Bear Stearns, but that he had undergone 15 months of treatment at that point to kick the habits.
In a tearful interview on CNBC, Kudlow thanked the network, which he said ""gave me a second chance after my crash and burn.""
""I love this place. I'm honored to take this position. It's an enormous honor. My life has had twists and turns, as people know,"" he said. ""With God's grace I'll have 23 years clean and sober in a few months. That made it all possible.""
Kudlow's official title will be assistant to the president for economic policy and director of the National Economic Council. The post does not require Senate confirmation.",13,27,18.037037037037038,0,0.5525187004644138,0.3187246647323621,0.21169216584127684,0.20518329448233813,0.14814814814814814,0.4215703889863884,0.4156570405808562,0.19408663385547698,0.29550166968392694,0.26901226872351114,0.22854257718217533,0.1016766058281064,0.1857998591933004,0.06574773817323679,0.5656574321684151,0.11339347856144774,0.10759977628463731,0.9373339161473322,0.19028211934446496,0.14647917220143608,1.258115427270916,0.2551474470145357,0.14535559010950613,1.251699534693873,0.2528499925226702,0.0,0.02673992673992674,0.04878048780487805,0.04529616724738676,3.1866805026063396,3.5821007724861005,0,0,1.2104596009671198,6.989602094905532,8.694536647144359,1.311324331432724,0.4848082625614971,-1.8606220482338214,,-0.008761855677086391,-0.6270173513232916,-0.8202595112470754,-0.8340850363852285,0.18314163309808193,0.3572863813533955,0.9376232948309908,-1.0042587908704872,-1.3909291645238901,0.8541914569482393,0.650022779795202,-1.0566179551076236,-0.8774637400557215,-1.234396809038227,-1.2225346880574397,-1.224769414295583,-2.184832336897342,-2.1720395835041737,-2.091707654599875,-1.2598373557481026,-1.691293964838647,-1.2587363632932544,-1.5727845215644458,-1.8571621095175974,-1.5518757403573311,-1.0210577231409697,-0.22723639111572747,0.30168500974194246,1.0455973047435903,0.8151148320963952,0.7204843484602605,,,1.2532786025537648,1.9805747867923251,-0.4275862783530671,0,-4.258086910532379
99,reports_8.txt,"WASHINGTON After months of disputes with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, President Trump removed him Tuesday and nominated CIA Director Mike Pompeo to head the State Department.
White House officials said a Tillerson aide was also fired for giving reporters differing accounts of how the secretary of State learned of his fate. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the move.
The officials said they are bracing for more staff changes, citing Trump's comment Tuesday as he prepared to fly to California: ""I'm really at a point where we're getting very close to having the Cabinet and other things that I want.""
Tillerson, who said Trump called him hours after he tweeted an announcement about Pompeo's nomination, said his last day would be March 31, and he pledged an ""orderly and smooth transition.""
Trump said he made the decision on Tillerson, citing disagreements with the secretary of State that included North Korea diplomacy, steel and aluminum tariffs and the Iran nuclear agreement.
""I think Rex will be much happier now,"" Trump said.
Tillerson, whose voice cracked at times during a brief statement at the State Department, did not take questions.
Steve Goldstein, the Tillerson aide who was fired, said Tillerson wanted to stay as secretary of State.
As for Pompeo, Trump praised his new nominee's ""tremendous energy, tremendous intellect"" and said, ""Were always on the same wavelength. The relationship has been very good, and thats what I need as secretary of State.""
Trump said in a written statement that at the State Department, Pompeo ""will continue our program of restoring Americas standing in the world, strengthening our alliances, confronting our adversaries, and seeking the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.""
Before his departure to California, Trump said he got along with Tillerson, but they disagreed on things. Trump cited the Iran nuclear deal in particular: ""I think it's terrible. I guess he feels it was OK."" He complimented Tillerson for ""his commitment and his service, and I wish him well. Hes a good man.
Goldstein, undersecretary for public diplomacy, said Tillerson ""did not speak to the president and is unaware of the reason"" for the decision.
""The secretary had every intention of staying because of the critical progress made in national security,"" Goldstein said. ""He will miss his colleagues at the Department of State and the foreign ministers he has worked with throughout the world.""
Hours later, Goldstein was fired.
The two anonymous White House officials said chief of staff John Kelly spoke with Tillerson on Friday and Saturday about the change.
It was clear on Friday, one of the officials said.
The State Department said Tillerson did not speak to Trump something White House officials confirmed and the secretary didn't know about the final decision until the tweet.",17,24,23.0,0,0.689083725861881,0.501396700280948,0.07905474436633728,0.07809447216636994,0.4166666666666667,0.4473439384784017,0.41729460695882137,0.14017020263954214,0.3821490277804914,0.2724193124898842,0.2664053061785892,0.08803381957113743,0.2439426790760703,0.05087082538133634,0.4320897049909844,0.0867044468247952,0.1395929076251092,1.1860681783215314,0.24080661279456794,0.15662238894655697,1.3325425384784155,0.267826572401559,0.16093278898640107,1.3440303251923689,0.27295561933596113,0.021929824561403508,0.018300653594771243,0.04411764705882353,0.06692242114236999,3.136939652165993,3.573906945558143,0,0,1.1835154263725691,5.857099913178886,8.522340491823606,2.2581289028642937,0.1000398002111027,-0.7888363684914904,,0.9993319581729179,0.8714420604552797,-1.783617301902382,-1.8217624917483664,1.671656922213882,0.9379174623946073,0.9913392185039968,-1.4204947862945962,0.22820337641299565,0.9521623858168056,2.2225180771927753,-1.2316312610307631,0.8684129536219574,-1.5374523962992728,-1.55651156050889,-1.5525733996450088,-0.578592991568446,-0.5617280805850923,-0.487424015011743,-0.3470565736543233,-0.3377545401675873,-0.29202830297178145,0.13031898722733085,-0.09476249710573316,0.15955391796603077,-0.33175375506336496,-0.48032711115701326,0.17488916883066072,2.6250860976974697,0.3681233923084724,0.633403431470813,,,0.6934082528089515,-1.6623030808751298,-1.0834248602301157,0,-5.249991562423945
